<h2>
NOTE
</h2>

<p>
The papers gathered into this series, originally
published in various periodicals, have already
been reprinted—the earliest in date more than
thirty years ago; the others, with the exception of
two, more recently, in a volume entitled “Portraits
of Places.” They have been here once more placed
together, for the great advantage they will be felt
to derive from the company and support of Mr.
Pennell’s illustrations. Each article is marked with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi" name="Page_vi" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_vi">vi</a></span>
its date, and it is obvious that the impressions and
observations they for the most part embody had
sprung from an early stage of acquaintance with
their general subject-matter. They represent a
good many wonderments and judgments and emotions,
whether felicities or mistakes, the fine freshness
of which the author has—to his misfortune,
no doubt—sufficiently outlived. But they may
perhaps on that very account present something of
a curious interest. I may add that I have again
attentively looked them over, with a view to any
possible amendment of their form or enhancement
of their meaning, and that I have nowhere scrupled
to rewrite a sentence or a passage on judging it
susceptible of a better turn.

<h2>
LONDON
</h2>

<h3 class="lowpad">
I
</h3>

<p>
There is a certain evening that I count as virtually
a first impression,—the end of a wet,
black Sunday, twenty years ago, about the first of
March. There had been an earlier vision, but it
had turned to grey, like faded ink, and the occasion
I speak of was a fresh beginning. No doubt I had
mystic prescience of how fond of the murky modern
Babylon I was one day to become; certain it is that
as I look back I find every small circumstance of
those hours of approach and arrival still as vivid as
if the solemnity of an opening era had breathed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2" name="Page_2" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_2">2</a></span>
upon it. The sense of approach was already almost
intolerably strong at Liverpool, where, as I remember,
the perception of the English character of everything
was as acute as a surprise, though it could only
be a surprise without a shock. It was expectation
exquisitely gratified, superabundantly confirmed.
There was a kind of wonder indeed that England
should be as English as, for my entertainment, she
took the trouble to be; but the wonder would have
been greater, and all the pleasure absent, if the sensation
had not been violent. It seems to sit there
again like a visiting presence, as it sat opposite to
me at breakfast at a small table in a window of the
old coffee-room of the Adelphi Hotel—the unextended
(as it then was), the unimproved, the
unblushingly local Adelphi. Liverpool is not a romantic
city, but that smoky Saturday returns to me
as a supreme success, measured by its association
with the kind of emotion in the hope of which, for
the most part, we betake ourselves to far countries.
</p>

<p>
It assumed this character at an early hour—or
rather, indeed, twenty-four hours before—with the
sight, as one looked across the wintry ocean, of the
strange, dark, lonely freshness of the coast of Ireland.
Better still, before we could come up to the
city, were the black steamers knocking about in the
yellow Mersey, under a sky so low that they seemed
to touch it with their funnels, and in the thickest,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3" name="Page_3" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_3">3</a></span>
windiest light. Spring was already in the air, in the
town; there was no rain, but there was still less sun—one
wondered what had become, on this side of
the world, of the big white splotch in the heavens;
and the grey mildness, shading away into black at
every pretext, appeared in itself a promise. This
was how it hung about me, between the window
and the fire, in the coffee-room of the hotel—late
in the morning for breakfast, as we had been long
disembarking. The other passengers had dispersed,
knowingly catching trains for London (we had only
been a handful); I had the place to myself, and
I felt as if I had an exclusive property in the impression.
I prolonged it, I sacrificed to it, and it is
perfectly recoverable now, with the very taste of
the national muffin, the creak of the waiter’s shoes as
he came and went (could anything be so English
as his intensely professional back? it revealed a
country of tradition), and the rustle of the newspaper
I was too excited to read.
</p>

<p>
I continued to sacrifice for the rest of the day; it
didn’t seem to me a sentient thing, as yet, to enquire
into the means of getting away. My curiosity must
indeed have languished, for I found myself on the
morrow in the slowest of Sunday trains, pottering
up to London with an interruptedness which might
have been tedious without the conversation of an
old gentleman who shared the carriage with me and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4" name="Page_4" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_4">4</a></span>
to whom my alien as well as comparatively youthful
character had betrayed itself. He instructed me
as to the sights of London and impressed upon me
that nothing was more worthy of my attention than
the great cathedral of St. Paul. “Have you seen
St. Peter’s in Rome? St. Peter’s is more highly
embellished, you know; but you may depend upon
it that St. Paul’s is the better building of the two.”
The impression I began with speaking of was,
strictly, that of the drive from Euston, after dark,
to Morley’s Hotel in Trafalgar Square. It was not
lovely—it was in fact rather horrible; but as I
move again through dusky, tortuous miles, in the
greasy four-wheeler to which my luggage had compelled
me to commit myself, I recognise the first
step in an initiation of which the subsequent stages
were to abound in pleasant things. It is a kind of
humiliation in a great city not to know where you
are going, and Morley’s Hotel was then, to my imagination,
only a vague ruddy spot in the general
immensity. The immensity was the great fact, and
that was a charm; the miles of housetops and viaducts,
the complication of junctions and signals
through which the train made its way to the station
had already given me the scale. The weather had
turned to wet, and we went deeper and deeper into
the Sunday night. The sheep in the fields, on the
way from Liverpool, had shown in their demeanour
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5" name="Page_5" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_5">5</a></span>
a certain consciousness of the day; but this momentous
cab-drive was an introduction to the rigidities
of custom. The low black houses were as
inanimate as so many rows of coal-scuttles, save
where at frequent corners, from a gin-shop, there
was a flare of light more brutal still than the darkness.
The custom of gin—that was equally rigid,
and in this first impression the public-houses counted
for much.
</p>

<p>
Morley’s Hotel proved indeed to be a ruddy spot;
brilliant, in my recollection, is the coffee-room fire,
the hospitable mahogany, the sense that in the
stupendous city this, at any rate for the hour, was
a shelter and a point of view. My remembrance of
the rest of the evening—I was probably very tired—is
mainly a remembrance of a vast four-poster.
My little bedroom-candle, set in its deep basin,
caused this monument to project a huge shadow
and to make me think, I scarce knew why, of “The
Ingoldsby Legends.” If at a tolerably early hour
the next day I found myself approaching St. Paul’s,
it was not wholly in obedience to the old gentleman
in the railway-carriage: I had an errand in the City,
and the City was doubtless prodigious. But what
I mainly recall is the romantic consciousness of
passing under the Temple Bar, and the way two
lines of “Henry Esmond” repeated themselves in
my mind as I drew near the masterpiece of Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6" name="Page_6" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_6">6</a></span>
Christopher Wren. “The stout, red-faced woman”
whom Esmond had seen tearing after the staghounds
over the slopes at Windsor was not a bit
like the effigy “which turns its stony back upon St.
Paul’s and faces the coaches struggling up Ludgate
Hill.” As I looked at Queen Anne over the apron
of my hansom—she struck me as very small and
dirty, and the vehicle ascended the mild incline
without an effort—it was a thrilling thought that the
statue had been familiar to the hero of the incomparable
novel. All history appeared to live again, and
the continuity of things to vibrate through my mind.
</p>

<p>
To this hour, as I pass along the Strand, I take
again the walk I took there that afternoon. I love
the place to-day, and that was the commencement
of my passion. It appeared to me to present phenomena,
and to contain objects of every kind, of an
inexhaustible interest; in particular it struck me as
desirable and even indispensable that I should purchase
most of the articles in most of the shops. My
eyes rest with a certain tenderness on the places
where I resisted and on those where I succumbed.
The fragrance of Mr. Rimmel’s establishment is
again in my nostrils; I see the slim young lady (I
hear her pronunciation) who waited upon me there.
Sacred to me to-day is the particular aroma of the
hair-wash that I bought of her. I pause before the
granite portico of Exeter Hall (it was unexpectedly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7" name="Page_7" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_7">7</a></span>
narrow and wedge-like), and it evokes a cloud of
associations which are none the less impressive
because they are vague; coming from I don’t know
where—from “Punch,” from Thackeray, from volumes
of the “Illustrated London News” turned over
in childhood; seeming connected with Mrs. Beecher
Stowe and “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” Memorable is
a rush I made into a glover’s at Charing Cross—the
one you pass, going eastward, just before
you turn into the station; that, however, now that
I think of it, must have been in the morning, as
soon as I issued from the hotel. Keen within me
was a sense of the importance of deflowering, of
despoiling the shop.

<p>
A day or two later, in the afternoon, I found myself
staring at my fire, in a lodging of which I had
taken possession on foreseeing that I should spend
some weeks in London. I had just come in, and,
having attended to the distribution of my luggage,
sat down to consider my habitation. It was on the
ground floor, and the fading daylight reached it in
a sadly damaged condition. It struck me as stuffy
and unsocial, with its mouldy smell and its decoration
of lithographs and wax-flowers—an impersonal
black hole in the huge general blackness. The
uproar of Piccadilly hummed away at the end of the
street, and the rattle of a heartless hansom passed
close to my ears. A sudden horror of the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8" name="Page_8" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_8">8</a></span>
place came over me, like a tiger-pounce of homesickness
which had been watching its moment.
London was hideous, vicious, cruel, and above all
overwhelming; whether or no she was “careful of
the type,” she was as indifferent as Nature herself
to the single life. In the course of an hour I should
have to go out to my dinner, which was not supplied
on the premises, and that effort assumed the form
of a desperate and dangerous quest. It appeared to
me that I would rather remain dinnerless, would
rather even starve, than sally forth into the infernal
town, where the natural fate of an obscure stranger
would be to be trampled to death in Piccadilly and
have his carcass thrown into the Thames. I did
not starve, however, and I eventually attached myself
by a hundred human links to the dreadful, delightful
city. That momentary vision of its smeared
face and stony heart has remained memorable to
me, but I am happy to say that I can easily summon
up others.

<p>
It is, no doubt, not the taste of every one, but for
the real London-lover the mere immensity of the
place is a large part of its savour. A small London
would be an abomination, as it fortunately is an
impossibility, for the idea and the name are beyond
everything an expression of extent and number.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9" name="Page_9" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_9">9</a></span>
Practically, of course, one lives in a quarter, in a
plot; but in imagination and by a constant mental
act of reference the accommodated haunter enjoys
the whole—and it is only of him that I deem it
worth while to speak. He fancies himself, as they
say, for being a particle in so unequalled an aggregation;
and its immeasurable circumference, even
though unvisited and lost in smoke, gives him the
sense of a social, an intellectual margin. There is
a luxury in the knowledge that he may come and
go without being noticed, even when his comings
and goings have no nefarious end. I don’t mean by
this that the tongue of London is not a very active
member; the tongue of London would indeed be
worthy of a chapter by itself. But the eyes which at
least in some measure feed its activity are fortunately
for the common advantage solicited at any moment
by a thousand different objects. If the place is big,
everything it contains is certainly not so; but this
may at least be said—that if small questions play
a part there, they play it without illusions about its
importance. There are too many questions, small
or great; and each day, as it arrives, leads its children,
like a kind of mendicant mother, by the hand.
Therefore perhaps the most general characteristic
is the absence of insistence. Habits and inclinations
flourish and fall, but intensity is never one of them.
The spirit of the great city is not analytic, and, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10" name="Page_10" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_10">10</a></span>
they come up, subjects rarely receive at its hands
a treatment drearily earnest or tastelessly thorough.
There are not many—of those of which London
disposes with the assurance begotten of its large
experience—that wouldn’t lend themselves to a
tenderer manipulation elsewhere. It takes a very
great affair, a turn of the Irish screw or a divorce
case lasting many days, to be fully threshed out.
The mind of Mayfair, when it aspires to show what
it really can do, lives in the hope of a new divorce
case, and an indulgent providence—London is
positively in certain ways the spoiled child of the
world—abundantly recognises this particular aptitude
and humours the whim.
</p>

<p>
The compensation is that material does arise;
that there is a great variety, if not morbid subtlety;
and that the whole of the procession of events and
topics passes across your stage. For the moment
I am speaking of the inspiration there may be in
the sense of far frontiers; the London-lover loses
himself in this swelling consciousness, delights in the
idea that the town which encloses him is after all
only a paved country, a state by itself. This is his
condition of mind quite as much if he be an adoptive
as if he be a matter-of-course son. I am by no means
sure even that he need be of Anglo-Saxon race and
have inherited the birthright of English speech;
though, on the other hand, I make no doubt that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11" name="Page_11" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_11">11</a></span>
these advantages minister greatly to closeness of
allegiance. The great city spreads her dusky mantle
over innumerable races and creeds, and I believe
there is scarcely a known form of worship that has
not some temple there (have I not attended at the
Church of Humanity, in Lamb’s Conduit, in company
with an American lady, a vague old gentleman,
and several seamstresses?) or any communion
of men that has not some club or guild. London is
indeed an epitome of the round world, and just as
it is a commonplace to say that there is nothing
one can’t “get” there, so it is equally true that there
is nothing one may not study at first hand.
</p>

<p>
One doesn’t test these truths every day, but
they form part of the air one breathes (and welcome,
says the London-hater,—for there be such
perverse reasoners,—to the pestilent compound).
They colour the thick, dim distances which in my
opinion are the most romantic town-vistas in the
world; they mingle with the troubled light to which
the straight, ungarnished aperture in one’s dull,
undistinctive house-front affords a passage and which
makes an interior of friendly corners, mysterious
tones, and unbetrayed ingenuities, as well as with
the low, magnificent medium of the sky, where the
smoke and fog and the weather in general, the
strangely undefined hour of the day and season
of the year, the emanations of industries and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12" name="Page_12" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_12">12</a></span>
reflection of furnaces, the red gleams and blurs that
may or may not be of sunset—as you never see
any <i>source</i> of radiance, you can’t in the least tell—all
hang together in a confusion, a complication, a
shifting but irremoveable canopy. They form the
undertone of the deep, perpetual voice of the place.
One remembers them when one’s loyalty is on the
defensive; when it is a question of introducing as
many striking features as possible into the list of
fine reasons one has sometimes to draw up, that
eloquent catalogue with which one confronts the
hostile indictment—the array of <i>other</i> reasons
which may easily be as long as one’s arm. According
to these other reasons it plausibly and conclusively
stands that, as a place to be happy in, London
will never do. I don’t say it is necessary to meet so
absurd an allegation except for one’s personal complacency.
If indifference, in so gorged an organism,
is still livelier than curiosity, you may avail yourself
of your own share in it simply to feel that since
such and such a person doesn’t care for real richness,
so much the worse for such and such a person.
But once in a while the best believer recognises the
impulse to set his religion in order, to sweep the temple
of his thoughts and trim the sacred lamp. It
is at such hours as this that he reflects with elation
that the British capital is the particular spot in the
world which communicates the greatest sense of life.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13" name="Page_13" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_13">13</a></span>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
The reader will perceive that I do not shrink even
from the extreme concession of speaking of our
capital as British, and this in a shameless connection
with the question of loyalty on the part of an adoptive
son. For I hasten to explain that if half the
source of one’s interest in it comes from feeling that
it is the property and even the home of the human
race,—Hawthorne, that best of Americans, says
so somewhere, and places it in this sense side by
side with Rome,—one’s appreciation of it is really
a large sympathy, a comprehensive love of humanity.
For the sake of such a charity as this one may
stretch one’s allegiance; and the most alien of the
cockneyfied, though he may bristle with every protest
at the intimation that England has set its stamp
upon him, is free to admit with conscious pride that
he has submitted to Londonisation. It is a real
stroke of luck for a particular country that the capital
of the human race happens to be British. Surely
every other people would have it theirs if they could.
Whether the English deserve to hold it any longer
might be an interesting field of enquiry; but as they
have not yet let it slip, the writer of these lines
professes without scruple that the arrangement is to
his personal taste. For, after all, if the sense of life
is greatest there, it is a sense of the life of people of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14" name="Page_14" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_14">14</a></span>
our consecrated English speech. It is the headquarters
of that strangely elastic tongue; and I
make this remark with a full sense of the terrible
way in which the idiom is misused by the populace
in general, than whom it has been given to few
races to impart to conversation less of the charm of
tone. For a man of letters who endeavours to cultivate,
however modestly, the medium of Shakespeare
and Milton, of Hawthorne and Emerson, who
cherishes the notion of what it has achieved and
what it may even yet achieve, London must ever
have a great illustrative and suggestive value, and
indeed a kind of sanctity. It is the single place in
which most readers, most possible lovers, are gathered
together; it is the most inclusive public and the
largest social incarnation of the language, of the
tradition. Such a personage may well let it go for
this, and leave the German and the Greek to speak
for themselves, to express the grounds of <i>their</i> predilection,
presumably very different.
</p>

<p>
When a social product is so vast and various, it
may be approached on a thousand different sides,
and liked and disliked for a thousand different
reasons. The reasons of Piccadilly are not those
of Camden Town, nor are the curiosities and discouragements
of Kilburn the same as those of
Westminster and Lambeth. The reasons of Piccadilly—I
mean the friendly ones—are those of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15" name="Page_15" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_15">15</a></span>
which, as a general thing, the rooted visitor remains
most conscious; but it must be confessed that even
these, for the most part, do not lie upon the surface.
The absence of style, or rather of the intention of
style, is certainly the most general characteristic of
the face of London. To cross to Paris under this
impression is to find one’s self surrounded with far
other standards. There everything reminds you
that the idea of beautiful and stately arrangement
has never been out of fashion, that the art of composition
has always been at work or at play. Avenues
and squares, gardens and quays, have been distributed
for effect, and to-day the splendid city reaps the
accumulation of all this ingenuity. The result is not
in every quarter interesting, and there is a tiresome
monotony of the “fine” and the symmetrical, above
all, of the deathly passion for making things “to
match.” On the other hand the whole air of the
place is architectural. On the banks of the Thames
it is a tremendous chapter of accidents—the London-lover
has to confess to the existence of miles
upon miles of the dreariest, stodgiest commonness.
Thousands of acres are covered by low black
houses of the cheapest construction, without ornament,
without grace, without character or even
identity. In fact there are many, even in the best
quarters, in all the region of Mayfair and Belgravia,
of so paltry and inconvenient, especially of so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16" name="Page_16" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_16">16</a></span>
diminutive a type (those that are let in lodgings—such
poor lodgings as they make—may serve as an
example), that you wonder what peculiarly limited
domestic need they were constructed to meet. The
great misfortune of London to the eye (it is true
that this remark applies much less to the City),
is the want of elevation. There is no architectural
impression without a certain degree of height, and
the London street-vista has none of that sort of
pride.
</p>

<p>
All the same, if there be not the intention, there
is at least the accident, of style, which, if one looks
at it in a friendly way, appears to proceed from
three sources. One of these is simply the general
greatness, and the manner in which that makes
a difference for the better in any particular spot; so
that, though you may often perceive yourself to be
in a shabby corner, it never occurs to you that this
is the end of it. Another is the atmosphere, with its
magnificent mystifications, which flatters and superfuses,
makes everything brown, rich, dim, vague,
magnifies distances and minimises details, confirms
the inference of vastness by suggesting that,
as the great city makes everything, it makes its own
system of weather and its own optical laws. The
last is the congregation of the parks, which constitute
an ornament not elsewhere to be matched,
and give the place a superiority that none of its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17" name="Page_17" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_17">17</a></span>
uglinesses overcome. They spread themselves with
such a luxury of space in the centre of the town that
they form a part of the impression of any walk, of
almost any view, and, with an audacity altogether
their own, make a pastoral landscape under the
smoky sky. There is no mood of the rich London
climate that is not becoming to them—I have seen
them look delightfully romantic, like parks in
novels, in the wettest winter—and there is scarcely
a mood of the appreciative resident to which they
have not something to say. The high things of
London, which here and there peep over them, only
make the spaces vaster by reminding you that you
are, after all, not in Kent or Yorkshire; and these
things, whatever they be—rows of “eligible”
dwellings, towers of churches, domes of institutions—take
such an effective grey-blue tint that a clever
water-colourist would seem to have put them in for
pictorial reasons.

<p>
The view from the bridge over the Serpentine
has an extraordinary nobleness, and it has often
seemed to me that the Londoner, twitted with his
low standard, may point to it with every confidence.
In all the town-scenery of Europe there can be few
things so fine; the only reproach it is open to is that
it begs the question by seeming—in spite of its
being the pride of five millions of people—not to
belong to a town at all. The towers of Notre Dame,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18" name="Page_18" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_18">18</a></span>
as they rise in Paris from the island that divides
the Seine, present themselves no more impressively
than those of Westminster as you see them looking
doubly far beyond the shining stretch of Hyde Park
water. Equally delectable is the large river-like
manner in which the Serpentine opens away between
its wooded shores. Just after you have crossed
the bridge (whose very banisters, old and ornamental,
of yellowish-brown stone, I am particularly
fond of), you enjoy on your left, through the gate of
Kensington Gardens as you go towards Bayswater,
an altogether enchanting vista—a foot-path over
the grass, which loses itself beneath the scattered
oaks and elms exactly as if the place were a “chase.”
There could be nothing less like London in general
than this particular morsel, and yet it takes London,
of all cities, to give you such an impression of the
country.
</p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
It takes London to put you in the way of a purely
rustic walk from Notting Hill to Whitehall. You
may traverse this immense distance—a most comprehensive
diagonal—altogether on soft, fine turf,
amid the song of birds, the bleat of lambs, the ripple
of ponds, the rustle of admirable trees. Frequently
have I wished that, for the sake of such a daily
luxury and of exercise made romantic, I were a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19" name="Page_19" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_19">19</a></span>
Government clerk living, in snug domestic conditions,
in a Pembridge villa,—let me suppose,—and
having my matutinal desk in Westminster.
I should turn into Kensington Gardens at their
northwest limit, and I should have my choice of a
hundred pleasant paths to the gates of Hyde Park.
In Hyde Park I should follow the water-side, or
the Row, or any other fancy of the occasion; liking
best, perhaps, after all, the Row in its morning
mood, with the mist hanging over the dark-red
course, and the scattered early riders taking an
identity as the soundless gallop brings them nearer.
I am free to admit that in the Season, at the conventional
hours, the Row becomes a weariness
(save perhaps just for a glimpse once a year, to
remind one’s self how much it is like Du Maurier);
the preoccupied citizen eschews it and leaves it for
the most part to the gaping barbarian. I speak of
it now from the point of view of the pedestrian; but
for the rider as well it is at its best when he passes
either too early or too late. Then, if he be not bent
on comparing it to its disadvantage with the bluer
and boskier alleys of the Bois de Boulogne, it will
not be spoiled by the fact that, with its surface
that looks like tan, its barriers like those of the ring
on which the clown stands to hold up the hoop to the
young lady, its empty benches and chairs, its occasional
orange-peel, its mounted policemen patrolling
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20" name="Page_20" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_20">20</a></span>
at intervals like expectant supernumeraries, it
offers points of real contact with a circus whose
lamps are out. The sky that bends over it is frequently
not a bad imitation of the dingy tent of
such an establishment. The ghosts of past cavalcades
seem to haunt the foggy arena, and somehow
they are better company than the mashers
and elongated beauties of current seasons. It is
not without interest to remember that most of the
salient figures of English society during the present
century—and English society means, or rather
has hitherto meant, in a large degree, English history—have
bobbed in the saddle between Apsley
House and Queen’s Gate. You may call the roll
if you care to, and the air will be thick with dumb
voices and dead names, like that of some Roman
amphitheatre.
</p>

<p>
It is doubtless a signal proof of being a London-lover
<i>quand même</i> that one should undertake an
apology for so bungled an attempt at a great public
place as Hyde Park Corner. It is certain that the
improvements and embellishments recently enacted
there have only served to call further attention to
the poverty of the elements and to the fact that this
poverty is terribly illustrative of general conditions.
The place is the beating heart of the great West
End, yet its main features are a shabby, stuccoed
hospital, the low park-gates, in their neat but unimposing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21" name="Page_21" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_21">21</a></span>
frame, the drawing-room windows of Apsley
House and of the commonplace frontages on the
little terrace beside it; to which must be added, of
course, the only item in the whole prospect that is
in the least monumental—the arch spanning the
private road beside the gardens of Buckingham
Palace. This structure is now bereaved of the rueful
effigy which used to surmount it—the Iron
Duke in the guise of a tin soldier—and has not
been enriched by the transaction as much as might
have been expected.<a name="FA_1" id="FA_1" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#FN_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> There is a fine view of Piccadilly
and Knightsbridge, and of the noble mansions,
as the house-agents call them, of Grosvenor
Place, together with a sense of generous space beyond
the vulgar little railing of the Green Park;
but, except for the impression that there would be
room for something better, there is nothing in
all this that speaks to the imagination: almost as
much as the grimy desert of Trafalgar Square the
prospect conveys the idea of an opportunity wasted.
</p>

<p>
None the less has it on a fine day in spring
an expressiveness of which I shall not pretend to
explain the source further than by saying that the
flood of life and luxury is immeasurably great there.
The edifices are mean, but the social stream itself
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22" name="Page_22" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_22">22</a></span>
is monumental, and to an observer not purely stolid
there is more excitement and suggestion than I can
give a reason for in the long, distributed waves of
traffic, with the steady policemen marking their
rhythm, which roll together and apart for so many
hours. Then the great, dim city becomes bright
and kind, the pall of smoke turns into a veil of haze
carelessly worn, the air is coloured and almost scented
by the presence of the biggest society in the world,
and most of the things that meet the eye—or perhaps
I should say more of them, for the most in London
is, no doubt, ever the realm of the dingy—present
themselves as “well appointed.” Everything
shines more or less, from the window-panes
to the dog-collars. So it all looks, with its myriad
variations and qualifications, to one who surveys
it over the apron of a hansom, while that vehicle of
vantage, better than any box at the opera, spurts
and slackens with the current.
</p>

<p class="caption">IN THE GREEN PARK</p>
</div>

<p>
It is not in a hansom, however, that we have
figured our punctual young man, whom we must
not desert as he fares to the southeast, and who has
only to cross Hyde Park Corner to find his way all
grassy again. I have a weakness for the convenient,
familiar, treeless, or almost treeless, expanse of the
Green Park and the friendly part it plays as a kind
of encouragement to Piccadilly. I am so fond of
Piccadilly that I am grateful to any one or anything
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23" name="Page_23" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_23">23</a></span>
that does it a service, and nothing is more worthy
of appreciation than the southward look it is permitted
to enjoy just after it passes Devonshire
House—a sweep of horizon which it would be
difficult to match among other haunts of men, and
thanks to which, of a summer’s day, you may spy,
beyond the browsed pastures of the foreground and
middle distance, beyond the cold chimneys of
Buckingham Palace and the towers of Westminster
and the swarming river-side and all the southern
parishes, the hard modern twinkle of the roof of the
Crystal Palace.
</p>

<p>
If the Green Park is familiar, there is still less
of the exclusive in its pendant, as one may call it,—for
it literally hangs from the other, down the
hill,—the remnant of the former garden of the
queer, shabby old palace whose black, inelegant
face stares up St. James’s Street. This popular
resort has a great deal of character, but I am free
to confess that much of its character comes from its
nearness to the Westminster slums. It is a park of
intimacy, and perhaps the most democratic corner
of London, in spite of its being in the royal and
military quarter and close to all kinds of stateliness.
There are few hours of the day when a thousand
smutty children are not sprawling over it, and the
unemployed lie thick on the grass and cover the
benches with a brotherhood of greasy corduroys. If
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24" name="Page_24" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_24">24</a></span>
the London parks are the drawing-rooms and clubs
of the poor,—that is of those poor (I admit it cuts
down the number) who live near enough to them to
reach them,—these particular grass-plots and alleys
may be said to constitute the very <i>salon</i> of the slums.
</p>

<p>
I know not why, being such a region of greatness,—great
towers, great names, great memories; at
the foot of the Abbey, the Parliament, the fine fragment
of Whitehall, with the quarters of the sovereign
right and left,—but the edge of Westminster
evokes as many associations of misery as of empire.
The neighbourhood has been much purified of late,
but it still contains a collection of specimens—though
it is far from unique in this—of the low,
black element. The air always seems to me heavy
and thick, and here more than elsewhere one hears
old England—the panting, smoke-stained Titan
of Matthew Arnold’s fine poem—draw her deep
breath with effort. In fact one is nearer to her heroic
lungs, if those organs are figured by the great pinnacled
and fretted talking-house on the edge of the
river. But this same dense and conscious air plays
such everlasting tricks to the eye that the Foreign
Office, as you see it from the bridge, often looks
romantic, and the sheet of water it overhangs poetic—suggests
an Indian palace bathing its feet in the
Ganges. If our pedestrian achieves such a comparison
as this he has nothing left but to go on to his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25" name="Page_25" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_25">25</a></span>
work—which he will find close at hand. He will
have come the whole way from the far northwest on
the green—which is what was to be demonstrated.
</p>

<h3>

<p>
I feel as if I were taking a tone almost of boastfulness,
and no doubt the best way to consider the
matter is simply to say—without going into the
treachery of reasons—that, for one’s self, one
likes this part or the other. Yet this course would
not be unattended with danger, inasmuch as at the
end of a few such professions we might find ourselves
committed to a tolerance of much that is deplorable.
London is so clumsy and so brutal, and has gathered
together so many of the darkest sides of life, that it
is almost ridiculous to talk of her as a lover talks
of his mistress, and almost frivolous to appear to
ignore her disfigurements and cruelties. She is like
a mighty ogress who devours human flesh; but to
me it is a mitigating circumstance—though it may
not seem so to every one—that the ogress herself
is human. It is not in wantonness that she fills her
maw, but to keep herself alive and do her tremendous
work. She has no time for fine discriminations,
but after all she is as good-natured as she is huge,
and the more you stand up to her, as the phrase is,
the better she takes the joke of it. It is mainly when
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26" name="Page_26" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_26">26</a></span>
you fall on your face before her that she gobbles
you up. She heeds little what she takes, so long as
she has her stint, and the smallest push to the right
or the left will divert her wavering bulk from one
form of prey to another. It is not to be denied that
the heart tends to grow hard in her company; but
she is a capital antidote to the morbid, and to live
with her successfully is an education of the temper,
a consecration of one’s private philosophy. She
gives one a surface for which in a rough world one
can never be too thankful. She may take away
reputations, but she forms character. She teaches
her victims not to “mind,” and the great danger
for them is perhaps that they shall learn the lesson
too well.
</p>

<p>
It is sometimes a wonder to ascertain what they
do mind, the best seasoned of her children. Many
of them assist, without winking, at the most unfathomable
dramas, and the common speech of
others denotes a familiarity with the horrible. It is
her theory that she both produces and appreciates
the exquisite; but if you catch her in flagrant repudiation
of both responsibilities and confront her
with the shortcoming, she gives you a look, with a
shrug of her colossal shoulders, which establishes a
private relation with you for evermore. She seems
to say: “Do you really take me so seriously as that,
you dear, devoted, voluntary dupe, and don’t you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27" name="Page_27" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_27">27</a></span>
know what an immeasurable humbug I am?” You
reply that you shall know it henceforth; but your
tone is good-natured, with a touch of the cynicism
that she herself has taught you; for you are aware
that if she makes herself out better than she is, she
also makes herself out much worse. She is immensely
democratic, and that, no doubt, is part of
the manner in which she is salutary to the individual;
she teaches him his “place” by an incomparable
discipline, but deprives him of complaint by
letting him see that she has exactly the same lash
for every other back. When he has swallowed the
lesson he may enjoy the rude but unfailing justice
by which, under her eye, reputations and positions
elsewhere esteemed great are reduced to the relative.
There are so many reputations, so many positions,
that supereminence breaks down, and it is
difficult to be so rare that London can’t match you.
It is a part of her good-nature and one of her clumsy
coquetries to pretend sometimes that she hasn’t
your equivalent, as when she takes it into her head
to hunt the lion or form a ring round a celebrity.
But this artifice is so very transparent that the lion
must be very candid or the celebrity very obscure
to be taken by it. The business is altogether
subjective, as the philosophers say, and the great
city is primarily looking after herself. Celebrities
are convenient—they are one of the things that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28" name="Page_28" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_28">28</a></span>
people are asked to “meet”—and lion-cutlets, put
upon ice, will nourish a family through periods of
dearth.

This is what I mean by calling London democratic.
You may be in it, of course, without being
of it; but from the moment you <i>are</i> of it—and on
this point your own sense will soon enough enlighten
you—you belong to a body in which a general
equality prevails. However exalted, however able,
however rich, however renowned you may be, there
are too many people at least as much so for your own
idiosyncrasies to count. I think it is only by being
beautiful that you may really prevail very much;
for the loveliness of woman it has long been noticeable
that London will go most out of her way. It
is when she hunts that particular lion that she
becomes most dangerous; then there are really moments
when you would believe, for all the world,
that she is thinking of what she can give, not of
what she can get. Lovely ladies, before this, have
paid for believing it, and will continue to pay in days
to come. On the whole the people who are least
deceived are perhaps those who have permitted
themselves to believe, in their own interest, that
poverty is not a disgrace. It is certainly not considered
so in London, and indeed you can scarcely
say where—in virtue of diffusion—it would more
naturally be exempt. The possession of money is,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29" name="Page_29" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_29">29</a></span>
of course, immensely an advantage, but that is a very
different thing from a disqualification in the lack of it.
</p>

<p>
Good-natured in so many things in spite of her
cynical tongue, and easy-going in spite of her tremendous
pace, there is nothing in which the large
indulgence of the town is more shown than in the
liberal way she looks at obligations of hospitality
and the margin she allows in these and cognate
matters. She wants above all to be amused; she
keeps her books loosely, doesn’t stand on small
questions of a chop for a chop, and if there be any
chance of people’s proving a diversion, doesn’t
know or remember or care whether they have
“called.” She forgets even if she herself have called.
In matters of ceremony she takes and gives a long
rope, wasting no time in phrases and circumvallations.
It is no doubt incontestable that one result
of her inability to stand upon trifles and consider
details is that she has been obliged in some ways to
lower rather portentously the standard of her manners.
She cultivates the abrupt—for even when
she asks you to dine a month ahead the invitation
goes off like the crack of a pistol—and approaches
her ends not exactly <i>par quatre chemins</i>. She doesn’t
pretend to attach importance to the lesson conveyed
in Matthew Arnold’s poem of “The Sick King in
Bokhara,” that,

London snatches it more than eagerly if that be
the only way she can get it. Good manners are a succession
of details, and I don’t mean to say that
she doesn’t attend to them when she has time.
She has it, however, but seldom—<i>que voulez-vous</i>?
Perhaps the matter of note-writing is as good
an example as another of what certain of the elder
traditions inevitably have become in her hands.
She lives by notes—they are her very heart-beats;
but those that bear her signatures are as disjointed
as the ravings of delirium, and have nothing but
a postage-stamp in common with the epistolary art.

<p>
If she doesn’t go into particulars it may seem
a very presumptuous act to have attempted to do so
on her behalf, and the reader will doubtless think
I have been punished by having egregiously failed in
my enumeration. Indeed nothing could well be
more difficult than to add up the items—the column
would be altogether too long. One may have
dreamed of turning the glow—if glow it be—of
one’s lantern on each successive facet of the jewel;
but, after all, it may be success enough if a confusion
of brightness be the result. One has not the
alternative of speaking of London as a whole, for
the simple reason that there is no such thing as the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31" name="Page_31" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_31">31</a></span>
whole. It is immeasurable—its embracing arms
never meet. Rather it is a collection of many wholes,
and of which of them is it most important to speak?
Inevitably there must be a choice, and I know of
none more scientific than simply to leave out what
we may have to apologise for. The uglinesses, the
“rookeries,” the brutalities, the night-aspect of
many of the streets, the gin-shops and the hour
when they are cleared out before closing—there
are many elements of this kind which have to be
counted out before a genial summary can be made.
</p>

<p>
And yet I should not go so far as to say that it is
a condition of such geniality to close one’s eyes
upon the immense misery; on the contrary, I think
it is partly because we are irremediably conscious
of that dark gulf that the most general appeal of
the great city remains exactly what it is, the largest
chapter of human accidents. I have no idea of what
the future evolution of the strangely mingled monster
may be; whether the poor will improve away
the rich, or the rich will expropriate the poor, or they
will all continue to dwell together on their present
imperfect terms of intercourse. Certain it is, at any
rate, that the impression of suffering is a part of
the general vibration; it is one of the things that
mingle with all the others to make the sound that
is supremely dear to the consistent London-lover—the
rumble of the tremendous human mill. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32" name="Page_32" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_32">32</a></span>
the note which, in all its modulations, haunts and
fascinates and inspires him. And whether or no
he may succeed in keeping the misery out of the
picture, he will freely confess that the latter is not
spoiled for him by some of its duskiest shades. We
are far from liking London well enough till we like
its defects: the dense darkness of much of its winter,
the soot on the chimney-pots and everywhere
else, the early lamplight, the brown blur of the
houses, the splashing of hansoms in Oxford Street
or the Strand on December afternoons.
</p>

<p>
There is still something that recalls to me the
enchantment of children—the anticipation of
Christmas, the delight of a holiday walk—in the
way the shop-fronts shine into the fog. It makes
each of them seem a little world of light and warmth,
and I can still waste time in looking at them with
dirty Bloomsbury on one side and dirtier Soho on
the other. There are winter effects, not intrinsically
sweet, it would appear, which somehow, in absence,
touch the chords of memory and even the fount
of tears; as for instance the front of the British
Museum on a black afternoon, or the portico, when
the weather is vile, of one of the big square clubs in
Pall Mall. I can give no adequate account of the
subtle poetry of such reminiscences; it depends
upon associations of which we have often lost the
thread. The wide colonnade of the Museum, its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33" name="Page_33" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_33">33</a></span>
symmetrical wings, the high iron fence in its granite
setting, the sense of the misty halls within, where
all the treasures lie—these things loom patiently
through atmospheric layers which instead of making
them dreary impart to them something of a
cheer of red lights in a storm. I think the romance
of a winter afternoon in London arises partly from
the fact that, when it is not altogether smothered,
the general lamplight takes this hue of hospitality.
Such is the colour of the interior glow of the clubs
in Pall Mall, which I positively like best when the
fog loiters upon their monumental staircases.
</p>

<p>
In saying just now that these retreats may easily
be, for the exile, part of the phantasmagoria of
homesickness, I by no means alluded simply to
their solemn outsides. If they are still more solemn
within, that does not make them any less dear,
in retrospect at least, to a visitor much bent upon
liking his London to the end. What is the solemnity
but a tribute to your nerves, and the stillness but
a refined proof of the intensity of life? To produce
such results as these the balance of many tastes
must be struck, and that is only possible in a very
high civilisation. If I seem to intimate that this
last abstract term must be the cheer of him who
has lonely possession of a foggy library, without
even the excitement of watching for some one to put
down the magazine he wants, I am willing to let the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34" name="Page_34" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_34">34</a></span>
supposition pass, for the appreciation of a London
club at one of the empty seasons is nothing but the
strong expression of a preference for the great city—by
no means so unsociable as it may superficially
appear—at periods of relative abandonment. The
London year is studded with holidays, blessed little
islands of comparative leisure—intervals of absence
for good society. Then the wonderful English
faculty for “going out of town for a little change”
comes into illimitable play, and families transport
their nurseries and their bath-tubs to those rural
scenes which form the real substratum of the national
life. Such moments as these are the paradise
of the genuine London-lover, for he then finds himself
face to face with the object of his passion; he
can give himself up to an intercourse which at other
times is obstructed by his rivals. Then every one
he knows is out of town, and the exhilarating sense
of the presence of every one he doesn’t know becomes
by so much the deeper.
</p>

<p>
This is why I pronounce his satisfaction not an
unsociable, but a positively affectionate emotion.
It is the mood in which he most measures the immense
humanity of the place and in which its limits
recede farthest into a dimness peopled with possible
illustrations. For his acquaintance, however numerous
it may be, is finite; whereas the other, the
unvisited London, is infinite. It is one of his pleasures
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35" name="Page_35" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_35">35</a></span>
to think of the experiments and excursions
he may make in it, even when these adventures don’t
particularly come off. The friendly fog seems to
protect and enrich them—to add both to the mystery
and security, so that it is most in the winter
months that the imagination weaves such delights.
They reach their climax perhaps during the strictly
social desolation of Christmas week, when the
country-houses are crowded at the expense of the
capital. Then it is that I am most haunted with
the London of Dickens, feel most as if it were still
recoverable, still exhaling its queerness in patches
perceptible to the appreciative. Then the big fires
blaze in the lone twilight of the clubs, and the new
books on the tables say, “Now at last you have
time to read me,” and the afternoon tea and toast,
and the torpid old gentleman who wakes up from
a doze to order potash-water, appear to make the
assurance good. It is not a small matter either, to
a man of letters, that this is the best time for writing,
and that during the lamplit days the white page he
tries to blacken becomes, on his table, in the circle of
the lamp, with the screen of the climate folding him
in, more vivid and absorbent. Those to whom it is
forbidden to sit up to work in the small hours may,
between November and March, enjoy a semblance
of this luxury in the morning. The weather makes
a kind of sedentary midnight and muffles the possible
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36" name="Page_36" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_36">36</a></span>
interruptions. It is bad for the eyesight, but
excellent for the image.
</p>

<p>
Of course it is too much to say that all the satisfaction
of life in London comes from literally living
there, for it is not a paradox that a great deal of it consists
in getting away. It is almost easier to leave it
than not to, and much of its richness and interest
proceeds from its ramifications, the fact that all
England is in a suburban relation to it. Such an
affair it is in comparison to get away from Paris or
to get into it. London melts by wide, ugly zones
into the green country, and becomes pretty insidiously,
inadvertently—without stopping to change.
It is the spoiling perhaps of the country, but it is
the making of the insatiable town, and if one is a
helpless and shameless cockney that is all one is
obliged to look at. Anything is excusable which
enlarges one’s civic consciousness. It ministers
immensely to that of the London-lover that, thanks
to the tremendous system of coming and going, to
the active, hospitable habits of the people, to the
elaboration of the railway-service, the frequency
and rapidity of trains, and last, though not least,
to the fact that much of the loveliest scenery in
England lies within a radius of fifty miles—thanks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37" name="Page_37" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_37">37</a></span>
to all this he has the rural picturesque at his door
and may cultivate unlimited vagueness as to the
line of division between centre and circumference.
It is perfectly open to him to consider the remainder
of the United Kingdom, or the British empire in
general, or even, if he be an American, the total of
the English-speaking territories of the globe, as the
mere margin, the fitted girdle.
</p>

<p>
Is it for this reason—because I like to think how
great we all are together in the light of heaven and
the face of the rest of the world, with the bond of
our glorious tongue, in which we labour to write
articles and books for each other’s candid perusal,
how great we all are and how great is the great city
which we may unite fraternally to regard as the
capital of our race—is it for this that I have a
singular kindness for the London railway-stations,
that I like them æsthetically, that they interest and
fascinate me, and that I view them with complacency
even when I wish neither to depart nor to
arrive? They remind me of all our reciprocities
and activities, our energies and curiosities, and our
being all distinguished together from other people
by our great common stamp of perpetual motion,
our passion for seas and deserts and the other side
of the globe, the secret of the impression of strength—I
don’t say of social roundness and finish—that
we produce in any collection of Anglo-Saxon types.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38" name="Page_38" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_38">38</a></span>
If in the beloved foggy season I delight in the spectacle
of Paddington, Euston, or Waterloo,—I confess
I prefer the grave northern stations,—I am
prepared to defend myself against the charge of
puerility; for what I seek and what I find in these
vulgar scenes is at bottom simply so much evidence
of our larger way of looking at life. The exhibition
of variety of type is in general one of the bribes by
which London induces you to condone her abominations,
and the railway-platform is a kind of compendium
of that variety. I think that nowhere so
much as in London do people wear—to the eye
of observation—definite signs of the sort of people
they may be. If you like above all things to know
the sort, you hail this fact with joy; you recognise
that if the English are immensely distinct from other
people, they are also socially—and that brings
with it, in England, a train of moral and intellectual
consequences—extremely distinct from each other.
You may see them all together, with the rich colouring
of their differences, in the fine flare of one of
Mr. W. H. Smith’s bookstalls—a feature not to
be omitted in any enumeration of the charms of
Paddington and Euston. It is a focus of warmth
and light in the vast smoky cavern; it gives the idea
that literature is a thing of splendour, of a dazzling
essence, of infinite gas-lit red and gold. A glamour
hangs over the glittering booth, and a tantalising
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39" name="Page_39" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_39">39</a></span>
air of clever new things. How brilliant must the
books all be, how veracious and courteous the fresh,
pure journals! Of a Saturday afternoon, as you
wait in your corner of the compartment for the
starting of the train, the window makes a frame for
the glowing picture. I say of a Saturday afternoon,
because that is the most characteristic time—it
speaks most of the constant circulation and in particular
of the quick jump, by express, just before
dinner, for the Sunday, into the hall of the country-house
and the forms of closer friendliness, the prolonged
talks, the familiarising walks which London
excludes.
</p>

<p>
There is the emptiness of summer as well, when
you may have the town to yourself, and I would
discourse of it—counting the summer from the
first of August—were it not that I fear to seem
ungracious in insisting so much on the negative
phases. In truth they become positive in another
manner, and I have an endearing recollection of
certain happy accidents attached to the only period
when London life may be said to admit of accident.
It is the most luxurious existence in the world, but
of that especial luxury—the unexpected, the extemporized—it
has in general too little. In a
very tight crowd you can’t scratch your leg, and in
London the social pressure is so great that it is difficult
to deflect from the perpendicular or to move
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40" name="Page_40" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_40">40</a></span>
otherwise than with the mass. There is too little
of the loose change of time; every half-hour has its
preappointed use, written down month by month
in a little book. As I intimated, however, the pages
of this volume exhibit from August to November
an attractive blankness; they represent the season
during which you may taste of that highest kind of
inspiration, the inspiration of the moment.
</p>

<p>
This is doubtless what a gentleman had in mind
who once said to me, in regard to the vast resources
of London and its having something for every taste,
“Oh, yes; when you are bored or want a little
change you can take the boat down to Blackwall.”
I have never had occasion yet to resort to this particular
remedy. Perhaps it’s a proof that I have
never been bored. Why Blackwall?  I indeed asked
myself at the time; nor have I yet ascertained what
distractions the mysterious name represents. My
interlocutor probably used it generically, as a free,
comprehensive allusion to the charms of the river
at large. Here the London-lover goes with him all
the way, and indeed the Thames is altogether such
a wonderful affair that he feels he has distributed
his picture very clumsily not to have put it in the
very forefront. Take it up or take it down, it is
equally an adjunct of London life, an expression
of London manners.

From Westminster to the sea its uses are commercial,

but none the less pictorial for that; while
in the other direction—taking it properly a little
further up—they are personal, social, athletic,
idyllic. In its recreative character it is absolutely
unique. I know of no other classic stream that is so
splashed about for the mere fun of it. There is
something almost droll and at the same time almost
touching in the way that on the smallest pretext of
holiday or fine weather the mighty population takes
to the boats. They bump each other in the narrow,
charming channel; between Oxford and Richmond
they make an uninterrupted procession. Nothing
is more suggestive of the personal energy of the people
and their eagerness to take, in the way of exercise
and adventure, whatever they can get. I hasten
to add that what they get on the Thames is exquisite,
in spite of the smallness of the scale and the
contrast between the numbers and the space. In a
word, if the river is the busiest suburb of London,
it is also by far the prettiest. That term applies to
it less of course from the bridges down, but it is
only because in this part of its career it deserves
a larger praise. To be consistent, I like it best when
it is all dyed and disfigured with the town, and you
look from bridge to bridge—they seem wonderfully
big and dim—over the brown, greasy current,
the barges and the penny-steamers, the black, sordid,
heterogeneous shores. This prospect, of which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42" name="Page_42" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_42">42</a></span>
so many of the elements are ignoble, etches itself
to the eye of the lover of “bits” with a power that is
worthy perhaps of a better cause.
</p>

<p>
The way that with her magnificent opportunity
London has neglected to achieve a river-front is of
course the best possible proof that she has rarely,
in the past, been in the architectural mood which
at present shows somewhat inexpensive signs of
settling upon her. Here and there a fine fragment
apologises for the failure which it doesn’t remedy.
Somerset House stands up higher perhaps than
anything else on its granite pedestal, and the palace
of Westminster reclines—it can hardly be said to
stand—on the big parliamentary bench of its terrace.
The Embankment, which is admirable if not
particularly interesting, does what it can, and the
mannered houses of Chelsea stare across at Battersea
Park like eighteenth-century ladies surveying
a horrid wilderness. On the other hand, the Charing
Cross railway-station, placed where it is, is a
national crime; Milbank prison is a worse act of
violence than any it was erected to punish, and the
water-side generally a shameless renunciation of
effect. We acknowledge, however, that its very
cynicism is expressive; so that if one were to choose
again—short of there being a London Louvre—between
the usual English irresponsibility in such
matters and some particular flight of conscience, one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43" name="Page_43" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_43">43</a></span>
would perhaps do as well to let the case stand. We
know what it is, the stretch from Chelsea to Wapping,
but we know not what it might be. It doesn’t
prevent my being always more or less thrilled, of
a summer afternoon, by the journey on a penny-steamer
to Greenwich.

<p>
But why do I talk of Greenwich and remind myself
of one of the unexecuted vignettes with which
it had been my plan that these desultory and, I fear,
somewhat incoherent remarks should be studded?
They will present to the reader no vignettes but
those which the artist who has kindly consented to
associate himself with my vagaries may be so good
as to bestow upon them. Why should I speak of
Hampstead, as the question of summer afternoons
just threatened to lead me to do after I should have
exhausted the subject of Greenwich, which I may
not even touch? Why should I be so arbitrary when
I have cheated myself out of the space privately intended
for a series of vivid and ingenious sketches
of the particular physiognomy of the respective
quarters of the town? I had dreamed of doing them
all, with their idiosyncrasies and the signs by which
you shall know them. It is my pleasure to have
learned these signs—a deeply interesting branch
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44" name="Page_44" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_44">44</a></span>
of observation—but I must renounce the display
of my lore.
</p>

<p>
I have not the conscience to talk about Hampstead,
and what a pleasant thing it is to ascend the
long hill which overhangs, as it were, St. John’s
Wood and begins at the Swiss Cottage—you must
mount from there, it must be confessed, as you can—and
pick up a friend at a house of friendship on
the top, and stroll with him on the rusty Heath,
and skirt the garden walls of the old square Georgian
houses which survive from the time when, near
as it is to-day to London, the place was a kind of
provincial centre, with Joanna Baillie for its muse,
and take the way by the Three Spaniards—I would
never miss that—and look down at the smoky city
or across at the Scotch firs and the red sunset. It
would never do to make a tangent in that direction
when I have left Kensington unsung and Bloomsbury
unattempted, and have said never a word about
the mighty eastward region—the queer corners,
the dark secrets, the rich survivals and mementoes
of the City. I particularly regret having sacrificed
Kensington, the once-delightful, the Thackerayan,
with its literary vestiges, its quiet, pompous red
palace, its square of Queen Anne, its house of Lady
Castlewood, its Greyhound tavern, where Henry
Esmond lodged.
</p>

<p>
But I can reconcile myself to this when I reflect
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45" name="Page_45" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_45">45</a></span>
that I have also sacrificed the Season, which doubtless,
from an elegant point of view, ought to have
been the central <i>morceau</i> in the panorama. I have
noted that the London-lover loves everything in the
place, but I have not cut myself off from saying that
his sympathy has degrees, or from remarking that
the sentiment of the author of these pages has never
gone all the way with the dense movement of the
British carnival. That is really the word for the
period from Easter to midsummer; it is a fine,
decorous, expensive, Protestant carnival, in which
the masks are not of velvet or silk, but of wonderful
deceptive flesh and blood, the material of the most
beautiful complexions in the world. Holding that
the great interest of London is the sense the place
gives us of multitudinous life, it is doubtless an
inconsequence not to care most for the phase of
greatest intensity. But there is life and life, and the
rush and crush of these weeks of fashion is after all
but a tolerably mechanical expression of human
forces. Nobody would deny that it is a more universal,
brilliant, spectacular one than can be seen anywhere
else; and it is not a defect that these forces
often take the form of women extremely beautiful.
I risk the declaration that the London season brings
together year by year an unequalled collection of
handsome persons. I say nothing of the ugly ones;
beauty has at the best been allotted to a small minority,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46" name="Page_46" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_46">46</a></span>
and it is never, at the most, anywhere, but a
question of the number by which that minority is
least insignificant.
</p>

<p>
There are moments when one can almost forgive
the follies of June for the sake of the smile which
the sceptical old city puts on for the time and which,
as I noted in an earlier passage of this disquisition,
fairly breaks into laughter where she is tickled by
the vortex of Hyde Park Corner. Most perhaps
does she seem to smile at the end of the summer
days, when the light lingers and lingers, though the
shadows lengthen and the mists redden and the
belated riders, with dinners to dress for, hurry away
from the trampled arena of the Park. The population
at that hour surges mainly westward and sees
the dust of the day’s long racket turned into a dull
golden haze. There is something that has doubtless
often, at this particular moment, touched the fancy
even of the bored and the <i>blasés</i> in such an emanation
of hospitality, of waiting dinners, of the festal
idea, of the whole spectacle of the West End preparing
herself for an evening six parties deep. The
scale on which she entertains is stupendous, and her
invitations and “reminders” are as thick as the
leaves of the forest.
</p>

<p>
For half an hour, from eight to nine, every pair
of wheels presents the portrait of a diner-out. To
consider only the rattling hansoms, the white neckties
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47" name="Page_47" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_47">47</a></span>
and “dressed” heads which greet you from
over the apron in a quick, interminable succession,
conveys the overwhelming impression of a complicated
world. Who are they all, and where are they
all going, and whence have they come, and what
smoking kitchens and gaping portals and marshalled
flunkies are prepared to receive them, from the
southernmost limits of a loosely interpreted, an
almost transpontine Belgravia, to the hyperborean
confines of St. John’s Wood? There are broughams
standing at every door, and carpets laid down for
the footfall of the issuing if not the entering reveller.
The pavements are empty now, in the fading light,
in the big sallow squares and the stuccoed streets
of gentility, save for the groups of small children
holding others that are smaller—Ameliar-Ann intrusted
with Sarah Jane—who collect, wherever the
strip of carpet lies, to see the fine ladies pass from
the carriage or the house. The West End is dotted
with these pathetic little gazing groups; it is the party
of the poor—<i>their</i> Season and way of dining out,
and a happy illustration of “the sympathy that prevails
between classes.” The watchers, I should add,
are by no means all children, but the lean mature
also, and I am sure these wayside joys are one of the
reasons of an inconvenience much deplored—the
tendency of the country poor to flock to London.
They who dine only occasionally or never at all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48" name="Page_48" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_48">48</a></span>
have plenty of time to contemplate those with whom
the custom has more amplitude. However, it was
not my intention to conclude these remarks in a
melancholy strain, and goodness knows that the
diners are a prodigious company. It is as moralistic
as I shall venture to be if I drop a very soft sigh on
the paper as I confirm that truth. Are they all illuminated
spirits and is their conversation the ripest
in the world? This is not to be expected, nor should
I ever suppose it to be desired that an agreeable
society should fail to offer frequent opportunity
for intellectual rest. Such a shortcoming is not one
of the sins of the London world in general, nor
would it be just to complain of that world, on any
side, on grounds of deficiency. It is not what London
fails to do that strikes the observer, but the
general fact that she does everything in excess.
Excess is her highest reproach, and it is her incurable
misfortune that there is really too much of her.
She overwhelms you by quantity and number—she
ends by making human life, by making civilisation,
appear cheap to you. Wherever you go,
to parties, exhibitions, concerts, “private views,”
meetings, solitudes, there are already more people
than enough on the field. How it makes you understand
the high walls with which so much of English
life is surrounded, and the priceless blessing of a
park in the country, where there is nothing animated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49" name="Page_49" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_49">49</a></span>
but rabbits and pheasants and, for the worst, the
importunate nightingales! And as the monster
grows and grows for ever, she departs more and
more—it must be acknowledged—from the ideal
of a convenient society, a society in which intimacy
is possible, in which the associated meet often and
sound and select and measure and inspire each
other, and relations and combinations have time to
form themselves. The substitute for this, in London,
is the momentary concussion of a million of atoms.
It is the difference between seeing a great deal of
a few and seeing a little of every one. “When did
you come—are you ‘going on?’” and it is over;
there is no time even for the answer. This may seem
a perfidious arraignment, and I should not make it
were I not prepared, or rather were I not eager, to
add two qualifications. One of these is that, cumbrously
vast as the place may be, I would not have
had it smaller by a hair’s-breadth or have missed
one of the fine and fruitful impatiences with which
it inspires you and which are at bottom a heartier
tribute, I think, than any great city receives. The
other is that out of its richness and its inexhaustible
good-humour it belies the next hour any generalisation
you may have been so simple as to make about it.

<h2>
BROWNING IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY
</h2>

<p>
The lovers of a great poet are the people in the
world who are most to be forgiven a little
wanton fancy about him, for they have before them,
in his genius and work, an irresistible example of
the application of the imaginative method to a
thousand subjects. Certainly, therefore, there are
many confirmed admirers of Robert Browning to
whom it will not have failed to occur that the consignment
of his ashes to the great temple of fame
of the English race was exactly one of those occasions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52" name="Page_52" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_52">52</a></span>
in which his own analytic spirit would have rejoiced
and his irrepressible faculty for looking at human
events in all sorts of slanting coloured lights have
found a signal opportunity. If he had been taken
with it as a subject, if it had moved him to the confused
yet comprehensive utterance of which he was
the great professor, we can immediately guess at
some of the sparks he would have scraped from it,
guess how splendidly, in the case, the pictorial sense
would have intertwined itself with the metaphysical.
For such an occasion would have lacked, for the
author of “The Ring and the Book,” none of the
complexity and convertibility that were dear to him.
Passion and ingenuity, irony and solemnity, the
impressive and the unexpected, would each have
forced their way through; in a word the author
would have been sure to take the special, circumstantial
view (the inveterate mark of all his speculation)
even of so foregone a conclusion as that
England should pay her greatest honour to one of
her greatest poets. As they stood in the Abbey, at
any rate, on Tuesday last, those of his admirers
and mourners who were disposed to profit by his
warrant for enquiring curiously may well have let
their fancy range, with its muffled step, in the
direction which <i>his</i> fancy would probably not have
shrunk from following, even perhaps to the dim
corners where humour and the whimsical lurk.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53" name="Page_53" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_53">53</a></span>
Only, we hasten to add, it would have taken
Robert Browning himself to render the multifold
impression.
</p>

<p>
One part of it on such occasion is of course
irresistible—the sense that these honours are the
greatest that a generous nation has to confer and
that the emotion that accompanies them is one of
the high moments of a nation’s life. The attitude of
the public, of the multitude, at such hours, is a great
expansion, a great openness to ideas of aspiration
and achievement; the pride of possession and of
bestowal, especially in the case of a career so complete
as Mr. Browning’s, is so present as to make
regret a minor matter. We possess a great man
most when we begin to look at him through the
glass plate of death; and it is a simple truth, though
containing an apparent contradiction, that the
Abbey never takes us so benignantly as when we
have a valued voice to commit to silence there. For
the silence is articulate after all, and in worthy instances
the preservation great. It is the other side
of the question that would pull most the strings of
irresponsible reflection—all those conceivable postulates
and hypotheses of the poetic and satiric
mind to which we owe the picture of how the bishop
ordered his tomb in St. Praxed’s. Macaulay’s
“temple of silence and reconciliation”—and none
the less perhaps because he himself is now a presence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54" name="Page_54" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_54">54</a></span>
there—strikes us, as we stand in it, not only as
local but as social, a sort of corporate company;
so thick, under its high arches, its dim transepts
and chapels, is the population of its historic names
and figures. They are a company in possession,
with a high standard of distinction, of immortality,
as it were; for there is something serenely inexpugnable
even in the position of the interlopers.
As they look out, in the rich dusk, from the cold
eyes of statues and the careful identity of tablets,
they seem, with their converging faces, to scrutinise
decorously the claims of each new recumbent glory,
to ask each other how he is to be judged as an
accession. How difficult to banish the idea that
Robert Browning would have enjoyed prefiguring
and playing with the mystifications, the reservations,
even perhaps the slight buzz of scandal, in the
Poets’ Corner, to which his own obsequies might
give rise! Would not his great relish, in so characteristic
an interview with his crucible, have been
his perception of the bewildering modernness, to
much of the society, of the new candidate for a
niche? That is the interest and the fascination,
from what may be termed the inside point of view,
of Mr. Browning’s having received, in this direction
of becoming a classic, the only official assistance
that is ever conferred upon English writers.

<p>
It is as classics on one ground and another—some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55" name="Page_55" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_55">55</a></span>
members of it perhaps on that of not being anything
else—that the numerous assembly in the Abbey
holds together, and it is as a tremendous and incomparable
modern that the author of “Men and
Women” takes his place in it. He introduces to his
predecessors a kind of contemporary individualism
which surely for many a year they had not been
reminded of with any such force. The tradition of
the poetic character as something high, detached,
and simple, which may be assumed to have prevailed
among them for a good while, is one that
Browning has broken at every turn; so that we can
imagine his new associates to stand about him, till
they have got used to him, with rather a sense of
failing measures. A good many oddities and a good
many great writers have been entombed in the
Abbey; but none of the odd ones have been so great
and none of the great ones so odd. There are plenty
of poets whose right to the title may be contested,
but there is no poetic head of equal power—crowned
and recrowned by almost importunate hands—from
which so many people would withhold the
distinctive wreath. All this will give the marble
phantoms at the base of the great pillars, and the
definite personalities of the honorary slabs something
to puzzle out until, by the quick operation
of time, the mere fact of his lying there among
the classified and protected makes even Robert
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56" name="Page_56" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_56">56</a></span>
Browning lose a portion of the bristling surface of
his actuality.
</p>

<p>
For the rest, judging from the outside and with
his contemporaries, we of the public can only feel
that his very modernness—by which we mean
the all-touching, all-trying spirit of his work, permeated
with accumulations and playing with knowledge—achieves
a kind of conquest, or at least of
extension, of the rigid pale. We cannot enter here
upon any account either of that or of any other element
of his genius, though surely no literary figure
of our day seems to sit more unconsciously for the
painter. The very imperfections of this original are
fascinating, for they never present themselves as
weaknesses; they are boldnesses and overgrowths,
rich roughnesses and humours, and the patient critic
need not despair of digging to the primary soil from
which so many disparities and contradictions spring.
He may finally even put his finger on some explanation
of the great mystery, the imperfect conquest
of the poetic form by a genius in which the poetic
passion had such volume and range. He may
successfully say how it was that a poet without a
lyre—for that is practically Browning’s deficiency:
he had the scroll, but not often the sounding strings—was
nevertheless, in his best hours, wonderfully
rich in the magic of his art, a magnificent master of
poetic emotion. He will justify on behalf of a multitude
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57" name="Page_57" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_57">57</a></span>
of devotees the great position assigned to a
writer of verse of which the nature or the fortune
has been (in proportion to its value and quantity)
to be treated rarely as quotable. He will do all this
and a great deal more besides; but we need not wait
for it to feel that something of our latest sympathies,
our latest and most restless selves, passed the other
day into the high part—the show-part, to speak
vulgarly—of our literature. To speak of Mr.
Browning only as he was in the last twenty years
of his life, how quick such an imagination as his
would have been to recognise all the latent or mystical
suitabilities that, in the last resort, might link
to the great Valhalla by the Thames a figure that
had become so conspicuously a figure of London!
He had grown to be intimately and inveterately of
the London world; he was so familiar and recurrent,
so responsive to all its solicitations, that, given the
endless incarnations he stands for to-day, he would
have been missed from the congregation of worthies
whose memorials are the special pride of the Londoner.
Just as his great sign to those who knew
him was that he was a force of health, of temperament,
of tone, so what he takes into the Abbey is an
immense expression of life—of life rendered with
large liberty and free experiment, with an unprejudiced
intellectual eagerness to put himself in
other people’s place, to participate in complications
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58" name="Page_58" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_58">58</a></span>
and consequences; a restlessness of psychological
research that might well alarm any pale company
for their formal orthodoxies.
</p>

<p>
But the illustrious whom he rejoins may be reassured,
as they will not fail to discover: in so far
as they are representative it will clear itself up that,
in spite of a surface unsuggestive of marble and a
reckless individualism of form, he is quite as representative
as any of them. For the great value of
Browning is that at bottom, in all the deep spiritual
and human essentials, he is unmistakably in the
great tradition—is, with all his Italianisms and
cosmopolitanisms, all his victimisation by societies
organised to talk about him, a magnificent example
of the best and least dilettantish English spirit.
That constitutes indeed the main chance for his
eventual critic, who will have to solve the refreshing
problem of how, if subtleties be not what the English
spirit most delights in, the author of, for instance,
“Any Wife to Any Husband” made them
his perpetual pasture, and yet remained typically of
his race. He was indeed a wonderful mixture of
the universal and the alembicated. But he played
with the curious and the special, they never submerged
him, and it was a sign of his robustness
that he could play to the end. His voice sounds
loudest, and also clearest, for the things that, as
a race, we like best—the fascination of faith, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59" name="Page_59" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_59">59</a></span>
acceptance of life, the respect for its mysteries, the
endurance of its charges, the vitality of the will,
the validity of character, the beauty of action, the
seriousness, above all, of the great human passion.
If Browning had spoken for us in no other way,
he ought to have been made sure of, tamed and
chained as a classic, on account of the extraordinary
beauty of his treatment of the special relation
between man and woman. It is a complete and
splendid picture of the matter, which somehow
places it at the same time in the region of conduct
and responsibility. But when we talk of Robert
Browning’s speaking “for us,” we go to the end of
our privilege, we say all. With a sense of security,
perhaps even a certain complacency, we leave our
sophisticated modern conscience, and perhaps even
our heterogeneous modern vocabulary, in his charge
among the illustrious. There will possibly be moments
in which these things will seem to us to have
widened the allowance, made the high abode more
comfortable, for some of those who are yet to enter it.

<h2>
CHESTER
</h2>

<p>
If the Atlantic voyage be counted, as it certainly
may, even with the ocean in a fairly good
humour, an emphatic zero in the sum of one’s better
experience, the American traveller arriving at this
venerable town finds himself transported, without
a sensible gradation, from the edge of the new world
to the very heart of the old. It is almost a misfortune
perhaps that Chester lies so close to the threshold of
England; for it is so rare and complete a specimen
of an antique town that the later-coming wonders of
its sisters in renown,—of Shrewsbury, Coventry,
and York—suffer a trifle by comparison, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62" name="Page_62" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_62">62</a></span>
tourist’s appetite for the picturesque just loses its
finer edge. Yet the first impressions of an observant
American in England—of our old friend the sentimental
tourist—stir up within him such a cloud
of sensibility that while the charm is still unbroken
he may perhaps as well dispose mentally of the
greater as of the less. I have been playing at first
impressions for the second time, and have won the
game against a cynical adversary. I have been strolling
and restrolling along the ancient wall—so perfect
in its antiquity—which locks this dense little
city in its stony circle, with a certain friend who has
been treating me to a bitter lament on the decay of
his relish for the picturesque. “I have turned the
corner of youth,” is his ceaseless plaint; “I suspected
it, but now I know it—now that my heart
beats but once where it beat a dozen times before,
and that where I found sermons in stones and pictures
in meadows, delicious revelations and intimations
ineffable, I find nothing but the hard, heavy
prose of British civilisation.” But little by little
I have grown used to my friend’s sad monody, and
indeed feel half indebted to it as a warning against
cheap infatuations.
</p>

<p>
I defied him, at any rate, to argue successfully
against the effect of the brave little walls of Chester.
There could be no better example of that phenomenon
so delightfully frequent in England—an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63" name="Page_63" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_63">63</a></span>
ancient property or institution lovingly readopted
and consecrated to some modern amenity. The
good Cestrians may boast of their walls without
a shadow of that mental reservation on grounds
of modern ease which is so often the tax paid by the
romantic; and I can easily imagine that, though
most modern towns contrive to get on comfortably
without this stony girdle, these people should have
come to regard theirs as a prime necessity. For
through it, surely, they may know their city more
intimately than their unbuckled neighbours—survey
it, feel it, rejoice in it as many times a day as they
please. The civic consciousness, sunning itself thus
on the city’s rim and glancing at the little swarming
towered and gabled town within, and then at
the blue undulations of the near Welsh border, may
easily deepen to delicious complacency. The wall
enfolds the place in a continuous ring, which, passing
through innumerable picturesque vicissitudes,
often threatens to snap, but never fairly breaks the
link; so that, starting at any point, an hour’s easy
stroll will bring you back to your station. I have
quite lost my heart to this charming creation, and
there are so many things to be said about it that I
hardly know where to begin. The great fact, I suppose,
is that it contains a Roman substructure, rests
for much of its course on foundations laid by that
race of master-builders. But in spite of this sturdy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64" name="Page_64" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_64">64</a></span>
origin, much of which is buried in the well-trodden
soil of the ages, it is the gentlest and least offensive
of ramparts; it completes its long irregular curve
without a frown or menace in all its disembattled
stretch. The earthy deposit of time has indeed in
some places climbed so high about its base that
it amounts to no more than a causeway of modest
dimensions. It has everywhere, however, a rugged
outer parapet and a broad hollow flagging, wide
enough for two strollers abreast. Thus equipped,
it wanders through its adventurous circuit; now
sloping, now bending, now broadening into a terrace,
now narrowing into an alley, now swelling
into an arch, now dipping into steps, now passing
some thorn-screened garden, and now reminding
you that it was once a more serious matter than all
this by the extrusion of a rugged, ivy-smothered
tower.

<p>
Its final hoary humility is enhanced, to your
mind, by the freedom with which you may approach
it from any point in the town. Every few
steps, as you go, you see some little court or alley
boring toward it through the close-pressed houses.
It is full of that delightful element of the crooked,
the accidental, the unforeseen, which, to American
eyes, accustomed to our eternal straight lines and
right angles, is the striking feature of European
street scenery. An American strolling in the Chester
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65" name="Page_65" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_65">65</a></span>
streets finds a perfect feast of crookedness—of
those random corners, projections, and recesses,
odd domestic interspaces charmingly saved or lost,
those innumerable architectural surprises and caprices
and fantasies which lead to such refreshing
exercise a vision benumbed by brown-stone fronts.
An American is born to the idea that on his walks
abroad it is perpetual level wall ahead of him, and
such a revelation as he finds here of infinite accident
and infinite effect gives a wholly novel zest to the
use of his eyes. It produces too the reflection—a
superficial and fallacious one perhaps—that amid
all this cunning chiaroscuro of its <i>mise en scène</i> life
must have more of a certain homely entertainment.
It is at least no fallacy to say that childhood—or
the later memory of childhood—must borrow from
such a background a kind of anecdotical wealth.
We all know how in the retrospect of later moods
the incidents of early youth “compose,” visibly,
each as an individual picture, with a magic for which
the greatest painters have no corresponding art.
There is a vivid reflection of this magic in some of
the early pages of Dickens’s “Copperfield” and
of George Eliot’s “Mill on the Floss,” the writers
having had the happiness of growing up among
old, old things. Two or three of the phases of this
rambling wall belong especially to the class of things
fondly remembered. In one place it skirts the edge
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66" name="Page_66" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_66">66</a></span>
of the cathedral graveyard and sweeps beneath the
great square tower and behind the sacred east window
of the choir.
</p>

<p>
Of the cathedral there is more to say; but just
the spot I speak of is the best standpoint for
feeling how fine an influence in the architectural
line—where theoretically, at least, influences are
great—is the massive tower of an English abbey,
dominating the homes of men; and for watching
the eddying flight of swallows make vaster still to
the eye the high calm fields of stonework. At another
point two battered and crumbling towers,
decaying in their winding-sheets of ivy, make a prodigiously
designed diversion. One inserted in the
body of the wall and the other connected with it by
a short, crumbling ridge of masonry, they contribute
to a positive jumble of local colour. A shaded mall
wanders at the foot of the rampart; beside this passes
a narrow canal, with locks and barges and burly
watermen in smocks and breeches; while the venerable
pair of towers, with their old red sandstone
sides peeping through the gaps in their green mantles,
rest on the soft grass of one of those odd fragments
of public garden, a crooked strip of ground
turned to social account, which one meets at every
turn, apparently, in England—a tribute to the
needs of the “masses.” <i>Stat magni nominis umbra.</i>
The quotation is doubly pertinent here, for this little
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67" name="Page_67" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_67">67</a></span>
garden-strip is adorned with mossy fragments of
Roman stonework, bits of pavement, altars, baths,
disinterred in the local soil. England is the land of
small economies, and the present rarely fails to find
good use for the odds and ends of the past. These
two hoary shells of masonry are therefore converted
into “museums,” receptacles for the dustiest and
shabbiest of tawdry back-parlour curiosities. Here
preside a couple of those grotesque creatures, <i>à la</i>
Dickens, whom one finds squeezed into every cranny
of English civilisation, scraping a thin subsistence
like mites in a mouldy cheese.
</p>

<p>
Next after its wall—possibly even before it—Chester
values its Rows, an architectural idiosyncrasy
which must be seen to be appreciated. They
are a sort of gothic edition of the blessed arcades
and porticoes of Italy, and consist, roughly speaking,
of a running public passage tunnelled through
the second story of the houses. The low basement
is thus directly on the drive-way, to which a flight
of steps descends, at frequent intervals, from this
superincumbent verandah. The upper portion of
the houses projects to the outer line of the gallery,
where they are propped with pillars and posts and
parapets. The shop-fronts face along the arcade
and admit you to little caverns of traffic, more or less
dusky according to their opportunities for illumination
in the rear. If the romantic be measured

by its hostility to our modern notions of convenience,
Chester is probably the most romantic city
in the world. This arrangement is endlessly rich in
opportunities for amusing effect, but the full charm
of the architecture of which it is so essential a part
must be observed from the street below. Chester is
still an antique town, and mediæval England sits
bravely under her gables. Every third house is a
“specimen”—gabled and latticed, timbered and
carved, and wearing its years more or less lightly.
These ancient dwellings present every shade and
degree of historical colour and expression. Some
are dark with neglect and deformity, and the horizontal
slit admitting light into the lurking Row
seems to collapse on its dislocated props like a pair
of toothless old jaws. Others stand there square-shouldered
and sturdy, with their beams painted
and straightened, their plaster whitewashed, their
carvings polished, and the low casement covering
the breadth of the frontage adorned with curtains
and flower-pots. It is noticeable that the actual
townsfolk have bravely accepted the situation bequeathed
by the past, and the large number of rich
and intelligent restorations of the old façades makes
an effective jumble of their piety and their policy.
These elaborate and ingenious repairs attest a highly
informed consciousness of the pictorial value of the
city. I indeed suspect much of this revived innocence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69" name="Page_69" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_69">69</a></span>
of having recovered a freshness that never can
have been, of having been restored with usurious
interest. About the genuine antiques there would
be properly a great deal to say, for they are really
a theme for the philosopher; but the theme is too
heavy for my pen, and I can give them but the passing
tribute of a sigh. They are cruelly quaint, dreadfully
expressive. Fix one of them with your gaze
and it seems fairly to reek with mortality. Every
stain and crevice seems to syllable some human
record—a record of lives airless and unlighted. I
have been trying hard to fancy them animated by
the children of “Merry England,” but I am quite
unable to think of them save as peopled by the victims
of dismal old-world pains and fears. Human
life, surely, packed away behind those impenetrable
lattices of lead and bottle-glass, just above which
the black outer beam marks the suffocating nearness
of the ceiling, can have expanded into scant
freedom and bloomed into small sweetness.

Nothing has struck me more in my strolls along
the Rows than the fact that the most zealous observation
can keep but uneven pace with the fine
differences in national manners. Some of the most
sensible of these differences are yet so subtle and
indefinable that one must give up the attempt to
express them, though the omission leave but a rough
sketch. As you pass with the bustling current from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70" name="Page_70" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_70">70</a></span>
shop to shop you feel local custom and tradition—another
tone of things—pressing on you from every
side. The tone of things is somehow heavier than
with us; manners and modes are more absolute
and positive; they seem to swarm and to thicken
the atmosphere about you. Morally and physically
it is a denser air than ours. We seem loosely hung
together at home as compared with the English,
every man of whom is a tight fit in his place. It is
not an inferential but a palpable fact that England
is a crowded country. There is stillness and space—grassy,
oak-studded space—at Eaton Hall, where
the Marquis of Westminster dwells (or I believe can
afford to humour his notion of not dwelling), but there
is a crowd and a hubbub in Chester. Wherever you
go the population has overflowed. You stroll on the
walls at eventide and you hardly find elbow-room.
You haunt the cathedral shades and a dozen sauntering
mortals temper your solitude. You glance up an
alley or side street and discover populous windows
and doorsteps. You roll along country roads and
find countless humble pedestrians dotting the green
waysides. The English landscape is always a “landscape
with figures.” And everywhere you go you
are accompanied by a vague consciousness of the
British child hovering about your knees and coat-skirts,
naked, grimy, and portentous. You reflect
with a sort of physical relief on Australia, Canada,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71" name="Page_71" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_71">71</a></span>
India. Where there are many men, of course, there
are many needs; which helps to justify to the philosophic
stranger the vast number and the irresistible
coquetry of the little shops which adorn these low-browed
Rows. The shop-fronts have always seemed
to me the most elegant things in England; and I
waste more time than I should care to confess to in
covetous contemplation of the vast, clear panes behind
which the nether integuments of gentlemen are
daintily suspended from glittering brass rods. The
manners of the dealers in these comfortable wares
seldom fail to confirm your agreeable impression.
You are thanked with effusion for expending twopence—a
fact of deep significance to the truly analytic
mind, and which always seems to me a vague
reverberation from certain of Miss Edgeworth’s
novels, perused in childhood. When you think of
the small profits, the small jealousies, the long waiting
and the narrow margin for evil days implied by
this redundancy of shops and shopmen, you hear
afresh the steady rumble of that deep keynote of
English manners, overscored so often, and with
such sweet beguilement, by finer harmonies, but
never extinguished—the economic struggle for
existence.

The Rows are as “scenic” as one could wish,
and it is a pity that before the birth of their modern
consciousness there was no English Balzac to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72" name="Page_72" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_72">72</a></span>
introduce them into a realistic romance with a psychological
commentary. But the cathedral is better
still, modestly as it stands on the roll of English
abbeys. It is of moderate dimensions and rather
meagre in form and ornament; but to an American
it expresses and answers for the type, producing
thereby the proper vibrations. Among these is a
certain irresistible regret that so much of its hoary
substance should give place to the fine, fresh-coloured
masonry with which Mr. Gilbert Scott, ruthless
renovator, is so intelligently investing it. The red
sandstone of the primitive structure, darkened and
devoured by time, survives at many points in frowning
mockery of the imputed need of tinkering. The
great tower, however,—completely restored,—rises
high enough to seem to belong, as cathedral towers
should, to the far-off air that vibrates with the chimes
and the swallows, and to square serenely, east and
west and south and north, its embossed and fluted
sides. English cathedrals, within, are apt at first to
look pale and naked; but after a while, if the proportions
be fair and the spaces largely distributed,
when you perceive the light beating softly down
from the cold clerestory and your eye measures
caressingly the tallness of columns and the hollowness
of arches, and lingers on the old genteel inscriptions
of mural marbles and brasses; and, above
all, when you become conscious of that sweet, cool
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73" name="Page_73" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_73">73</a></span>
mustiness in the air which seems to haunt these
places as the very climate of Episcopacy, you may
grow to feel that they are less the empty shells of a
departed faith than the abodes of a faith which may
still affirm a presence and awaken echoes. Catholicism
has gone, but Anglicanism has the next best
music. So at least it seemed to me, a Sunday or two
since, as I sat in the choir at Chester awaiting a discourse
from Canon Kingsley. The Anglican service
had never seemed to my profane sense so much an
affair of magnificent intonations and cadences—of
pompous effects of resonance and melody. The
vast oaken architecture of the stalls among which
we nestled—somewhat stiffly and with a due apprehension
of wounded ribs and knees—climbing
vainly against the dizzier reach of the columns; the
beautiful English voices of certain officiating canons,
the little rosy “king’s scholars” sitting ranged beneath
the pulpit, in white-winged surplices, which
made their heads, above the pew-edges, look like
rows of sleepy cherubs: every element in the scene
gave it a great spectacular beauty. They suggested
too what is suggested in England at every turn, that
conservatism here has all the charm and leaves
dissent and democracy and other vulgar variations
nothing but their bald logic. Conservatism has the
cathedrals, the colleges, the castles, the gardens,
the traditions, the associations, the fine names, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74" name="Page_74" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_74">74</a></span>
better manners, the poetry; Dissent has the dusky
brick chapels in provincial by-streets, the names out
of Dickens, the uncertain tenure of the <i>h</i>, and the
poor <i>mens sibi conscia recti</i>. Differences which in
other countries are slight and varying, almost metaphysical,
as one may say, are marked in England
by a gulf. Nowhere else does the degree of one’s
respectability involve such solid consequences, and
I am sure I don’t wonder that the sacramental word
which with us (and, in such correlatives as they possess,
more or less among the continental races) is
pronounced lightly and facetiously and as a quotation
from the Philistines, is uttered here with a perfectly
grave face. To have the courage of one’s mere
convictions is in short to have a prodigious deal of
courage, and I think one must need as much to be
a Dissenter as one needs patience not to be a duke.
Perhaps the Dissenters (to limit the question to
them) manage to stay out of the church by letting it
all hang on the sermon. Canon Kingsley’s discourse
was one more example of the familiar truth—not
without its significance to minds zealous for the good
old fashion of “making an effort,”—that there is
an odd link between large forms and small emanations.
The sermon, beneath that triply consecrated
vault, should have had a builded majesty. It had
not; and I confess that a tender memory of ancient
obligations to the author of “Westward Ho!” and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75" name="Page_75" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_75">75</a></span>
“Hypatia” forbids my saying more of it. An American,
I think, is not incapable of taking a secret satisfaction
in an incongruity of this kind. He finds with
relief that even mortals reared as in the ring of
a perpetual circus are only mortals. His constant
sense of the beautiful scenic properties of English
life is apt to beget a habit of melancholy reference
to the dead-blank wall which forms the background
of our own life-drama; and from doubting in this
fantastic humour whether we have even that modest
value in the scale of beauty that he has sometimes
fondly hoped, he lapses into a moody scepticism as
to our place in the scale of “importance,” and finds
himself wondering vaguely whether this be not a
richer race as well as a lovelier land. That of course
will never do; so that when after being escorted
down the beautiful choir in what, from the American
point of view, is an almost gorgeous ecclesiastical
march, by the Dean in a white robe trimmed
with scarlet and black-robed sacristans carrying
silver wands, the officiating canon mounts into a
splendid canopied and pinnacled pulpit of gothic
stonework and proves—not an “acting” Jeremy
Taylor, our poor sentimental tourist begins to hold
up his head again and to reflect that so far as we
<i>have</i> opportunities we mostly rise to them. I am
not sure indeed that in the excess of his reaction he
is not tempted to accuse his English neighbours
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76" name="Page_76" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_76">76</a></span>
of being impenetrable and uninspired, to affirm
that they do not half discern their good fortune,
and that it takes passionate pilgrims, vague aliens,
and other disinherited persons to appreciate the
“points” of this admirable country.

<h2>
LICHFIELD AND WARWICK
</h2>

<p>
To write at Oxford of anything but Oxford requires,
on the part of the sentimental tourist,
no small power of mental abstraction. Yet I have
it at heart to pay to three or four other scenes recently
visited the debt of an enjoyment hardly less
profound than my relish for this scholastic paradise.
First among these is the cathedral city of Lichfield—the
city, I say, because Lichfield has a character of
its own apart from its great ecclesiastical feature.
In the centre of its little market-place—dullest and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78" name="Page_78" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_78">78</a></span>
sleepiest of provincial market-places—rises a huge
effigy of Dr. Johnson, the <i>genius loci</i>, who was
constructed, humanly, with very nearly as large an
architecture as the great abbey. The Doctor’s statue,
which is of some inexpensive composite painted
a shiny brown, and of no great merit of design, fills
out the vacant dulness of the little square in much
the same way as his massive personality occupies—with
just a margin for Garrick—the record of his
native town. In one of the volumes of Croker’s
“Boswell” is a steel plate of the old Johnsonian
birth-house, by the aid of a vague recollection of
which I detected the dwelling beneath its modernised
frontage. It bears no mural inscription and,
save for a hint of antiquity in the receding basement,
with pillars supporting the floor above, seems in no
especial harmony with Johnson’s time or fame. Lichfield
in general appeared to me indeed to have little
to say about her great son beyond the fact that the
smallness and the sameness and the dulness, amid
which it is so easy to fancy a great intellectual appetite
turning sick with inanition, may help to explain
the Doctor’s subsequent almost ferocious fondness
for London. I walked about the silent streets, trying
to repeople them with wigs and short-clothes, and,
while I lingered near the cathedral, endeavoured to
guess the message of its gothic graces to Johnson’s
ponderous classicism. But I achieved but a colourless
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79" name="Page_79" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_79">79</a></span>
picture at the best, and the most vivid image in
my mind’s eye was that of the London coach facing
towards Temple Bar with the young author of “Rasselas”
scowling near-sightedly from the cheapest
seat. With him goes the interest of Lichfield town.
The place is stale without being really antique. It is
as if that prodigious temperament had absorbed and
appropriated its original vitality.
</p>

<p>
If every dull provincial town, however, formed
but a girdle of quietude to a cathedral as rich as that
of Lichfield, one would thank it for letting one alone.
Lichfield cathedral is great among churches, and
bravely performs the prime duty of objects of its
order—that of seeming for the time (to minds
unsophisticated by architectural culture) the finest,
on the whole, of all such objects. This one is rather
oddly placed, on the slope of a hill, the particular
spot having been chosen, I believe, because sanctified
by the sufferings of certain primitive martyrs;
but it is fine to see how its upper portions surmount
any crookedness of posture and its great towers overtake
in mid-air the conditions of perfect symmetry.
The close is extraordinarily attractive; a long sheet
of water expands behind it and, besides leading
the eye off into a sweet green landscape, renders
the inestimable service of reflecting the three spires
as they rise above the great trees which mask the
Palace and the Deanery. These august abodes edge
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80" name="Page_80" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_80">80</a></span>
the northern side of the slope, and behind their
huge gate-posts and close-wrought gates the atmosphere
of the Georgian era seems to abide. Before
them stretches a row of huge elms, which must have
been old when Johnson was young; and between
these and the long-buttressed wall of the cathedral,
you may stroll to and fro among as pleasant a mixture
of influences (I imagine) as any in England.
You can stand back here, too, from the west front
further than in many cases, and examine at your
ease its lavish decoration. You are perhaps a trifle
too much at your ease, for you soon discover what
a more cursory glance might not betray, that the
immense façade has been covered with stucco and
paint, that an effigy of Charles II, in wig and
plumes and trunk-hose, of almost gothic grotesqueness,
surmounts the middle window; that the various
other statues of saints and kings have but recently
climbed into their niches; and that the whole expanse
is in short an imposture. All this was done
some fifty years ago, in the taste of that day as to
restoration, and yet it but partially mitigates the
impressiveness of the high façade, with its brace of
spires, and the great embossed and image-fretted
surface, to which the lowness of the portals (the too
frequent reproach of English abbeys) seems to give
a loftier reach. Passing beneath one of these low
portals, however, I found myself gazing down as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81" name="Page_81" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_81">81</a></span>
noble a church vista as any you need desire. The
cathedral is of magnificent length, and the screen
between nave and choir has been removed, so that
from stem to stern, as one may say, of the great vessel
of the church, it is all a mighty avenue of multitudinous
slender columns, terminating in what
seems a great screen of ruby and sapphire and topaz—one
of the finest east windows in England. The
cathedral is narrow in proportion to its length; it is
the long-drawn aisle of the poet in perfection, and
there is something grandly elegant in the unity of
effect produced by this unobstructed perspective.
The charm is increased by a singular architectural
fantasy. Standing in the centre of the doorway, you
perceive that the eastern wall does not directly face
you, and that from the beginning of the choir the
receding aisle deflects slightly to the left, in reported
suggestion of the droop of the Saviour’s head on
the cross. Here again Mr. Gilbert Scott has lately
laboured to no small purpose of <i>un</i>doing, it would
appear—undoing the misdeeds of the last century.
This extraordinary period expended an incalculable
amount of imagination in proving that it had none.
Universal whitewash was the least of its offences.
But this has been scraped away and the solid stonework
left to speak for itself, the delicate capitals and
cornices disencrusted and discreetly rechiselled and
the whole temple æsthetically rededicated. Its most
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82" name="Page_82" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_82">82</a></span>
beautiful feature, happily, has needed no repair, for
its perfect beauty has been its safeguard. The great
choir window of Lichfield is the noblest glasswork
before the spell of which one’s soul has become
simple. I remember nowhere colours so chaste and
grave, and yet so rich and true, or a cluster of designs
so piously decorative and yet so vivified. Such
a window as this seems to me the most sacred ornament
of a great church; to be, not like vault and
screen and altar, the dim contingent promise to the
spirit, but the very redemption of the whole vow.
This Lichfield glass is not the less interesting for
being visibly of foreign origin. Exceeding so obviously
as it does the range of English genius in this
line, it indicates at least the heavenly treasure stored
up in continental churches. It dates from the early
sixteenth century, and was transferred hither sixty
years ago from a decayed Belgian abbey. This,
however, is not all of Lichfield. You have not
seen it till you have strolled and restrolled along
the close on every side, and watched the three spires
constantly change their relation as you move and
pause. Nothing can well be finer than the combination
of the two lesser ones soaring equally in front
with the third riding tremendously the magnificently
sustained line of the roof. At a certain distance
against the sky this long ridge seems something infinite
and the great spire to sit astride of it like a giant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83" name="Page_83" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_83">83</a></span>
mounted on a mastodon. Your sense of the huge
mass of the building is deepened by the fact that
though the central steeple is of double the elevation
of the others, you see it, from some points,
borne back in a perspective which drops it to half
their stature and lifts them into immensity. But
it would take long to tell all that one sees and fancies
and thinks in a lingering walk about so great
a church as this.

<p>
To walk in quest of any object that one has more
or less tenderly dreamed of, to find your way, to steal
upon it softly, to see at last, if it be church or castle,
the tower-tops peeping above elms or beeches—to
push forward with a rush, and emerge and pause
and draw that first long breath which is the compromise
between so many sensations: this is a pleasure
left to the tourist even after the broad glare of
photography has dissipated so many of the sweet
mysteries of travel; even in a season when he is
fatally apt to meet a dozen fellow pilgrims returning
from the shrine, each as big a fool, so to speak, as
he ever was, or to overtake a dozen more telegraphing
their impressions down the line as they arrive.
Such a pleasure I lately enjoyed quite in its perfection,
in a walk to Haddon Hall, along a meadow-path
by the Wye, in this interminable English twilight
which I am never weary of admiring watch in
hand. Haddon Hall lies among Derbyshire hills, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84" name="Page_84" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_84">84</a></span>
region infested, I was about to write, by Americans.
But I achieved my own sly pilgrimage in perfect solitude;
and as I descried the grey walls among the
rook-haunted elms I felt not like a dusty tourist,
but like a successful adventurer. I have certainly
had, as a dusty tourist, few more charming moments
than some—such as any one, I suppose, is free to
have—that I passed on a little ruined grey bridge
which spans, with its single narrow arch, a trickling
stream at the base of the eminence from which those
walls and trees look down. The twilight deepened,
the ragged battlements and the low, broad oriels
glanced duskily from the foliage, the rooks wheeled
and clamoured in the glowing sky; and if there had
been a ghost on the premises I certainly ought to
have seen it. In fact I did see it, as we see ghosts
nowadays. I felt the incommunicable spirit of the
scene with the last, the right intensity. The old life,
the old manners, the old figures seemed present
again. The great <i>coup de théâtre</i> of the young woman
who shows you the Hall—it is rather languidly
done on her part—is to point out a little dusky
door opening from a turret to a back terrace as
the aperture through which Dorothy Vernon eloped
with Lord John Manners. I was ignorant of this
episode, for I was not to enter the place till the morrow,
and I am still unversed in the history of the
actors. But as I stood in the luminous dusk weaving
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85" name="Page_85" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_85">85</a></span>
the romance of the spot, I recognised the inevitability
of a Dorothy Vernon and quite understood a
Lord John. It was of course on just such an evening
that the romantic event came off, and by listening
with the proper credulity I might surely hear on the
flags of the castle-court ghostly footfalls and feel in
their movement the old heartbeats. The only footfall
I can conscientiously swear to, however, is the
far from spectral tread of the damsel who led me
through the mansion in the prosier light of the next
morning. Haddon Hall, I believe, is one of the
sights in which it is the fashion to be “disappointed;”
a fact explained in a great measure by the absence
of a formal approach to the house, which shows its
low, grey front to every trudger on the high-road.
But the charm of the spot is so much less that of
grandeur than that of melancholy, that it is rather
deepened than diminished by this attitude of obvious
survival and decay. And for that matter, when
you have entered the steep little outer court through
the huge thickness of the low gateway, the present
seems effectually walled out and the past walled in,
even as a dead man in a sepulchre. It is very dead,
of a fine June morning, the genius of Haddon Hall;
and the silent courts and chambers, with their hues
of ashen grey and faded brown, seem as time-bleached
as the dry bones of any mouldering mortality.
The comparison is odd, but Haddon Hall
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86" name="Page_86" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_86">86</a></span>
reminded me perversely of some of the larger houses
at Pompeii. The private life of the past is revealed
in each case with very much the same distinctness
and on a scale small enough not to stagger the
imagination. This old dwelling indeed has so little
of the mass and expanse of the classic feudal castle
that it almost suggests one of those miniature models
of great buildings which lurk in dusty corners of
museums. But it is large enough to be delectably
complete and to contain an infinite store of the poetry
of grass-grown courts looked into by wide, jutting
windows and climbed out of by crooked stone
stairways mounting against the walls to little high-placed
doors. The “tone” of Haddon Hall, of all
its walls and towers and stonework, is the grey of
unpolished silver, and the reader who has been in
England need hardly be reminded of the sweet accord—to
eye and mind alike—existing between
all stony surfaces covered with the pale corrosions of
time and the deep living green of the strong ivy which
seems to feed on their slow decay. Of this effect and
of a hundred others—from those that belong to
low-browed, stone-paved empty rooms where life
was warm and atmospheres thick, to those one may

on a level with the highest beech-tops, against the
cracked and sun-baked parapet which flaunted the
castle standard over the castle woods—of every

form of sad desuetude and picturesque decay Haddon
Hall contains some delightful example. Its finest
point is undoubtedly a certain court from which
a stately flight of steps ascends to the terrace where
that daughter of the Vernons whom I have mentioned
took such happy thought for our requiring,
as the phrase is, a reference. These steps, with the
terrace, its balustrade topped with great ivy-muffled
knobs of stone and its high background of massed
woods, form the ideal <i>mise en scène</i> for portions of
Shakespeare’s comedies. “It’s exactly Elizabethan,”
said my companion. Here the Countess Olivia may
have listened to the fantastic Malvolio, or Beatrix,
superbest of flirts, have come to summon Benedick
to dinner.
</p>

<p>
The glories of Chatsworth, which lies but a few
miles from Haddon, serve as a marked offset to its
more delicate merits, just as they are supposed to
gain, I believe, in the tourist’s eyes, by contrast with
its charming, its almost Italian shabbiness. But the
glories of Chatsworth, incontestable as they are,
were so effectually eclipsed to my mind, a couple of
days later, that in future, when I think of an English
mansion, I shall think only of Warwick, and when
I think of an English park, only of Blenheim. Your
run by train through the gentle Warwickshire land
does much to prepare you for the great spectacle
of the castle, which seems hardly more than a sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88" name="Page_88" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_88">88</a></span>
massive symbol and synthesis of the broad prosperity
and peace and leisure diffused over this great
pastoral expanse. The Warwickshire meadows are
to common English scenery what this is to that of the
rest of the world. For mile upon mile you can see
nothing but broad sloping pastures of velvet turf,
overbrowsed by sheep of the most fantastic shagginess
and garnished with hedges out of the trailing
luxury of whose verdure great ivy-tangled oaks and
elms arise with a kind of architectural regularity.
The landscape indeed sins by excess of nutritive
suggestion; it savours of larder and manger; it is
too ovine, too bovine, it is almost asinine; and if
you were to believe what you see before you this
rugged globe would be a sort of boneless ball covered
with some such plush-like integument as might
be figured by the down on the cheek of a peach.
But a great thought keeps you company as you go
and gives character to the scenery. Warwickshire—you
say it over and over—was Shakespeare’s
country. Those who think that a great genius is
something supremely ripe and healthy and human
may find comfort in the fact. It helps greatly to
enliven my own vague conception of Shakespeare’s
temperament, with which I find it no great shock
to be obliged to associate ideas of mutton and beef.
There is something as final, as disillusioned of the
romantic horrors of rock and forest, as deeply attuned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89" name="Page_89" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_89">89</a></span>
to human needs in the Warwickshire pastures
as there is in the underlying morality of the poet.

<p class="caption">WARWICK CASTLE</p>
</div>

<p>
With human needs in general Warwick Castle
may be in no great accord, but few places are more
gratifying to the sentimental tourist. It is the only
great residence he may have coveted as a home. The
fire that we heard so much of last winter in America
appears to have consumed but an inconsiderable
and easily spared portion of the house, and the great
towers rise over the great trees and the town with the
same grand air as before. Picturesquely, Warwick
gains from not being sequestered, after the common
fashion, in acres of park. The village street winds
about the garden walls, though its hum expires before
it has had time to scale them. There can be no
better example of the way in which stone walls, if
they do not of necessity make a prison, may on occasions
make a palace, than the prodigious privacy
maintained thus about a mansion whose windows
and towers form the main feature of a bustling
town. At Warwick the past joins hands so stoutly
with the present that you can hardly say where one
begins and the other ends, and you rather miss the
various crannies and gaps of what I just now called
the Italian shabbiness of Haddon. There is a Cæsar’s
tower and a Guy’s tower and half a dozen more, but
they are so well-conditioned in their ponderous antiquity
that you are at loss whether to consider them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90" name="Page_90" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_90">90</a></span>
parts of an old house revived or of a new house picturesquely
superannuated. Such as they are, however,
plunging into the grassed and gravelled courts
from which their battlements look really feudal, and
into gardens large enough for all delight and too
small, as they should be, to be amazing; and with
ranges between them of great apartments at whose
hugely recessed windows you may turn from Vandyck
and Rembrandt to glance down the cliff-like
pile into the Avon, washing the base like a lordly
moat, with its bridge, and its trees and its memories,
they mark the very model of a great hereditary
dwelling—one which amply satisfies the imagination
without irritating the democratic conscience.
The pictures at Warwick reminded me afresh of an
old conclusion on this matter; that the best fortune
for good pictures is not to be crowded into public
collections—not even into the relative privacy of
Salons Carrés and Tribunes—but to hang in largely-spaced
half-dozens on the walls of fine houses.
Here the historical atmosphere, as one may call it,
is almost a compensation for the often imperfect
light. If this be true of most pictures it is especially
so of the works of Vandyck, whom you think of,
wherever you may find him, as having, with that
thorough good-breeding which is the stamp of his
manner, taken account in his painting of the local
conditions and predestined his picture to just the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91" name="Page_91" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_91">91</a></span>
spot where it hangs. This is in fact an illusion as
regards the Vandycks at Warwick, for none of them
represent members of the house. The very finest
perhaps after the great melancholy, picturesque
Charles I—death, or at least the presentiment of
death on the pale horse—is a portrait from the
Brignole palace at Genoa; a beautiful noble matron
in black, with her little son and heir. The last
Vandycks I had seen were the noble company this
lady had left behind her in the Genoese palace, and
as I looked at her I thought of her mighty change
of circumstance. Here she sits in the mild light of
midmost England; there you could almost fancy her
blinking in the great glare sent up from the Mediterranean.
Intensity for intensity—intensity of situation
constituted—I hardly know which to choose.

<h2>
NORTH DEVON
</h2>

<p>
For those fanciful observers to whom broad
England means chiefly the perfection of the
rural picturesque, Devonshire means the perfection
of England. I, at least, had so complacently taken
for granted here all the characteristic graces of
English scenery, had built so boldly on their rank
orthodoxy, that before we fairly crossed the border
I had begun to look impatiently from the carriage
window for the veritable landscape in water-colours.
Devonshire meets you promptly in all its purity, for
the course of ten minutes you have been able to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94" name="Page_94" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_94">94</a></span>
glance down the green vista of a dozen Devonshire
lanes. On huge embankments of moss and turf,
smothered in wild flowers and embroidered with the
finest lacework of trailing ground-ivy, rise solid
walls of flowering thorn and glistening holly and
golden broom, and more strong, homely shrubs
than I can name, and toss their blooming tangle to
a sky which seems to look down between them, in
places, from but a dozen inches of blue. They are
oversown with lovely little flowers with names as
delicate as their petals of gold and silver and azure—bird’s-eye
and king’s-finger and wandering-sailor—and
their soil, a superb dark red, turns in spots
so nearly to crimson that you almost fancy it some
fantastic compound purchased at the chemist’s and
scattered there for ornament. The mingled reflection
of this rich-hued earth and the dim green light which
filters through the hedge is a masterpiece of produced
beauty. A Devonshire cottage is no less striking an
outcome of the ages and the seasons and the manners.
Crushed beneath its burden of thatch, coated with
a rough white stucco of a tone to delight a painter,
nestling in deep foliage and garnished at doorstep
and wayside with various forms of chubby infancy, it
seems to have been stationed there for no more obvious
purpose than to keep a promise to your fancy,
though it covers, I suppose, not a little of the sordid
side of life which the fancy likes to slur over.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95" name="Page_95" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_95">95</a></span>

<p>
I rolled past lanes and cottages to Exeter, where
I had counted upon the cathedral. When one has
fairly tasted of the pleasure of cathedral-hunting
the approach to each new possible prize of the chase
gives a peculiarly agreeable zest to the curiosity.
You are making a collection of great impressions,
and I think the process is in no case so delightful as
applied to cathedrals. Going from one fine picture
to another is certainly good; but the fine pictures
of the world are terribly numerous, and they have
a troublesome way of crowding and jostling each
other in the memory. The number of cathedrals is
small, and the mass and presence of each specimen
great, so that as they rise in the mind in individual
majesty they dwarf all the commoner impressions of
calculated effect. They form indeed but a gallery
of vaster pictures; for when time has dulled the
recollection of details you retain a single broad
image of the vast grey edifice, with its head and
shoulders, its vessel and its towers, its tone of colour,
its still green precinct. All this is especially true
perhaps of one’s sense of English sacred piles,
which are almost alone in possessing, as pictures,
a spacious and harmonious setting. The cathedral
stands supreme, but the close makes, always, the
<i>scene</i>. Exeter is not one of the grandest, but, in common
with great and small, it has certain points in
favour of which local learning discriminates. Exeter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96" name="Page_96" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_96">96</a></span>
indeed does itself injustice by a low, dark front,
which not only diminishes the apparent altitude
of the nave, but conceals, as you look eastward, two
noble Norman towers. The front, however, which
has a gloomy impressiveness, is redeemed by two
fine features: a magnificent rose-window, whose
vast stone ribs (enclosing some very pallid last-century
glass) are disposed with the most charming
intricacy; and a long sculptured screen—a sort
of stony band of images—which traverses the
façade from side to side. The little broken-visaged
effigies of saints and kings and bishops, niched in
tiers along this hoary wall, are prodigiously black
and quaint and primitive in expression; and as you
look at them with whatever contemplative tenderness
your trade of hard-working tourist may have
left at your disposal, you fancy that they are broodingly
conscious of their names, histories, and misfortunes;
that, sensitive victims of time, they feel
the loss of their noses, their toes, and their crowns;
and that, when the long June twilight turns at last
to a deeper grey and the quiet of the close to a deeper
stillness, they begin to peer sidewise out of their
narrow recesses and to converse in some strange
form of early English, as rigid, yet as candid, as
their features and postures, moaning, like a company
of ancient paupers round a hospital fire, over
their aches and infirmities and losses and the sadness
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97" name="Page_97" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_97">97</a></span>
of being so terribly old. The vast square transeptal
towers of the church seem to me to have the same
sort of personal melancholy. Nothing in all architecture
expresses better, to my imagination, the sadness
of survival, the resignation of dogged material
continuance, than a broad expanse of Norman
stonework, roughly adorned with its low relief of
short columns and round arches and almost barbarous
hatchet-work, and lifted high into that mild
English light which accords so well with its dull-grey
surface. The especial secret of the impressiveness
of such a Norman tower I cannot pretend to
have discovered. It lies largely in the look of having
been proudly and sturdily built—as if the masons
had been urged by a trumpet-blast, and the stones
squared by a battle-axe—contrasted with this mere
idleness of antiquity and passive lapse into quaintness.
A Greek temple preserves a kind of fresh
immortality in its concentrated refinement, and a
gothic cathedral in its adventurous exuberance;
but a Norman tower stands up like some simple
strong man in his might, bending a melancholy
brow upon an age which demands that strength
shall be cunning.

<p class="caption">THE NORMAN TOWERS OF EXETER</p>
</div>

<p>
The North Devon coast, whither it was my design
on coming to Exeter to proceed, has the primary
merit of being, as yet, virgin soil as to railways. I
went accordingly from Barnstable to Ilfracombe on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98" name="Page_98" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_98">98</a></span>
the top of a coach, in the fashion of elder days; and,
thanks to my position, I managed to enjoy the landscape
in spite of the two worthy aboriginals before
me who were reading aloud together, with a natural
glee which might have passed for fiendish malice,
the “Daily Telegraph’s” painfully vivid account
of the defeat of the Atalanta crew. It seemed to me,
I remember, a sort of pledge and token of the invincibility
of English muscle that a newspaper record
of its prowess should have power to divert my companions’ eyes
from the bosky flanks of Devonshire
combes. The little watering-place of Ilfracombe is
seated at the lower verge of one of these seaward-plunging
valleys, between a couple of magnificent
headlands which hold it in a hollow slope and offer
it securely to the caress of the Bristol Channel. It
is a very finished little specimen of its genus, and
I think that during my short stay there I expended
as much attention on its manners and customs and
its social physiognomy as on its cliffs and beach
and great coast-view. My chief conclusion perhaps,
from all these things, was that the terrible “summer-question”
which works annual anguish in so
many American households would rage less hopelessly
if we had a few Ilfracombes scattered along
our Atlantic coast; and furthermore that the English
are masters of the art of not losing sight of ease
and convenience in the pursuit of the pastoral life—unlike
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99" name="Page_99" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_99">99</a></span>
our own people, who, when seeking rural beguilement,
are apt but to find a new rudeness added
to nature. It is just possible that at Ilfracombe ease
and convenience weigh down the scale; so very
substantial are they, so very officious and business-like.
On the left of the town (to give an example)
one of the great cliffs I have mentioned rises in a
couple of massive peaks and presents to the sea an
almost vertical face, all muffled in tufts of golden
broom and mighty fern. You have not walked fifty
yards away from the hotel before you encounter
half a dozen little sign-boards, directing your steps
to a path up the cliff. You follow their indications
and you arrive at a little gate-house, with photographs
and various local gimcracks exposed for
sale. A most respectable person appears, demands
a penny and, on receiving it, admits you with great
civility to commune with nature. You detect, however,
various little influences hostile to perfect communion.
You are greeted by another sign-board
threatening legal pursuit if you attempt to evade
the payment of the sacramental penny. The path,
winding in a hundred ramifications over the cliff,
is fastidiously solid and neat, and furnished at intervals
of a dozen yards with excellent benches, inscribed
by knife and pencil with the names of such
visitors as do not happen to have been the elderly
maiden ladies who now chiefly occupy them. All
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100" name="Page_100" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_100">100</a></span>
this is prosaic, and you have to subtract it in a lump
from the total impression before the sense of the
beguilement of nature becomes distinct. Your
subtraction made, a great deal assuredly remains;
quite enough, I found, to give me an ample day’s
refreshment; for English scenery, like most other
English commodities, resists and rewards familiar
use. The cliffs are superb, the play of light and
shade upon them is a perpetual study, and the air
a particular mixture of the breath of the hills and
moors and the breath of the sea. I was very glad,
at the end of my climb, to have a good bench to sit
upon—as one must think twice in England before
measuring one’s length on the grassy earth; and to
be able, thanks to the smooth foot-path, to get back
to the hotel in a quarter of an hour. But it occurred
to me that if I were an Englishman of the period,
and, after ten months of a busy London life, my
fancy were turning to a holiday, to rest and change
and oblivion of the ponderous social burden, it
might find rather less inspiration than needful in
a vision of the little paths of Ilfracombe, of the sign-boards
and the penny-fee and the solitude tempered
by old ladies and sheep. I wondered whether
change perfect enough to be salutary does not imply
something more pathless, more idle, more unreclaimed
from that deep-bosomed nature to which
the overwrought mind reverts with passionate longing;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101" name="Page_101" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_101">101</a></span>
something after all attainable at a moderate
distance from New York and Boston. I must add
that I cannot find in my heart to object, even on
grounds the most æsthetic, to the very beautiful and
excellent inn at Ilfracombe, where such of my
readers as are perchance actually wrestling with the
question of “where to go” may be interested to
learn that they may live <i>en pension</i>, very well indeed,
at a cost of ten shillings a day. I have paid
the American hotel-clerk a much heavier tax on a
much lighter entertainment. I made the acquaintance
at this establishment of that strange fruit of
time the insular table d’hôte, but I confess that,
faithful to the habit of a tourist open to the <i>arrière-pensée</i>,
I have retained a more vivid impression of
the talk and the faces than of our joints and side-dishes.
I noticed here what I have often noticed
before (the truth perhaps has never been duly recognised),
that no people profit so eagerly as the
English by the suspension of a common social law.
A table d’hôte, being something abnormal and
experimental, as it were, resulted apparently in
a complete reversal of the supposed national characteristics.
Conversation was universal—uproarious
almost; old legends and ironies about the insular
<i>morgue</i> seemed to see their ground crumble away.
What social, what psychologic earthquake, in our
own time, had occurred?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102" name="Page_102" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_102">102</a></span>
</p>

<p>
These are meagre memories, however, compared
with those which cluster about that place of pleasantness
which is locally known as Lynton. I am afraid
I may seem a mere professional gusher when I
declare how common almost any term appears to
me applied to Lynton with descriptive intent. The
little village is perched on the side of one of the
great mountain-cliffs with which this whole coast is
adorned, and on the edge of a lovely gorge through
which a broad hill-torrent foams and tumbles from
the great moors whose heather-crested waves rise
purple along the inland sky. Below it, close beside
the beach where the little torrent meets the sea, is the
sister village of Lynmouth. Here—as I stood on the
bridge that spans the stream and looked at the stony
backs and foundations and overclambering garden
verdure of certain little grey old houses which
plunge their feet into it, and then up at the tender
green of scrub-oak and fern, at the colour of gorse
and broom and bracken climbing the sides of the
hills and leaving them bare-crowned to the sun like
miniature mountains—I read an unnatural blueness
into the northern sea, and the village below
put on the grace of one of the hundred hamlets of
the Riviera. The little Castle Hotel at Lynton is
a spot so consecrated to supreme repose—to sitting
with a book in the terrace-garden, among blooming
plants of aristocratic magnitude and rarity, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103" name="Page_103" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_103">103</a></span>
watching the finest piece of colour in all nature, the
glowing red and green of the great cliffs beyond the
little harbour-mouth, as they shift and change and
melt, the livelong day, from shade to shade and
ineffable tone to tone—that I feel as if in helping
it to publicity I were doing it rather a disfavour than
a service. It is in fact a very deep and sure retreat,
and I have never known one where purchased hospitality
wore a more disinterested smile. Lynton
is of course a capital centre for excursions, but two
or three of which I had time to make. None is more
beautiful than a simple walk along the running
face of the cliffs to a singular rocky eminence whose
curious abutments and pinnacles of stone have
inevitably caused it to be named the Castle. It
has a fantastic resemblance to some hoary feudal
ruin, with crumbling towers and gaping chambers
tenanted by wild sea-birds. The late afternoon light
had a way, at this season, of lingering on until
within a couple of hours of midnight; and I remember
among the charmed moments of English travel
none of a more vividly poetical tinge than a couple of
evenings spent on the summit of this all but legendary
pile in company with the slow-coming darkness
and the short, sharp cry of the sea-mews.
There are places whose very aspect is a story or
a song. This jagged and pinnacled coast-wall, with
the rock-strewn valley behind it, the sullen calmness
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104" name="Page_104" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_104">104</a></span>
of the unbroken tide at the dreadful base of the
cliffs (where they divide into low sea-caves, making
pillars and pedestals for the fantastic imagery of
their summits), prompted one to wanton reminiscence
and outbreak, to a recall of some drawing
of Gustave Doré’s (of his good time), which was
a divination of the place and made one look for his
signature under a stone, or, better still, to respouting,
for sympathy and relief, some idyllic Tennysonian
line that had haunted one’s destitute past and that
seemed to speak of the conditions in spite of being
false to them geographically.
</p>

<p>
The last stage in my visit to North Devon was the
long drive along the beautiful remnant of coast and
through the rich pastoral scenery of Somerset. The
whole broad spectacle that one dreams of viewing in
a foreign land to the homely music of a postboy’s
whip I beheld on this admirable drive—breezy
highlands clad in the warm blue-brown of heather-tufts
as if in mantles of rusty velvet, little bays and
coves curving gently to the doors of clustered fishing-huts,
deep pastures and broad forests, villages
thatched and trellised as if to take a prize for improbability,
manor-tops peeping over rook-haunted
avenues. I ought to make especial note of an hour
I spent at midday at the little village of Porlock
in Somerset. Here the thatch seemed steeper and
heavier, the yellow roses on the cottage walls more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105" name="Page_105" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_105">105</a></span>
cunningly mated with the crumbling stucco, the
dark interiors within the open doors more quaintly
pictorial, than elsewhere; and as I loitered, while
the horses rested, in the little cool old timber-steepled,
yew-shaded church, betwixt the high-backed
manorial pew and the battered tomb of a
crusading knight and his lady, and listened to the
simple prattle of a blue-eyed old sexton, who showed
me where, as a boy, in scantier corduroys, he had
scratched his name on the recumbent lady’s breast,
it seemed to me that this at last was old England
indeed, and that in a moment more I should see
Sir Roger de Coverley marching up the aisle. Certainly,
to give a proper account of it all, I should
need nothing less than the pen of Mr. Addison.

The pleasantest thing in life is doubtless ever
the pleasantness that has found one off one’s
guard—though if I was off my guard in arriving
at Wells it could only have been by the effect of a
frivolous want of information. I knew in a general
way that this ancient little town had a great cathedral
to produce, but I was far from suspecting the
intensity of the impression that awaited me. The
immense predominance of the Minster towers, as
you see them from the approaching train over the
clustered houses at their feet, gives you indeed an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108" name="Page_108" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_108">108</a></span>
intimation of its character, suggests that the city is
nothing if not sanctified; but I can wish the traveller
no better fortune than to stroll forth in the early
evening with as large a reserve of ignorance as my
own, and treat himself to an hour of discoveries.
I was lodged on the edge of the Cathedral lawn and
had only to pass beneath one of the three crumbling
Priory gates which enclose it, and cross the
vast grassy oval, to stand before a minster-front
which ranks among the first three or four in England.
Wells Cathedral is extremely fortunate in
being approached by this wide green level, on which
the spectator may loiter and stroll to and fro and
shift his standpoint to his heart’s content. The spectator
who does not hesitate to avail himself of his
privilege of unlimited fastidiousness might indeed
pronounce it too isolated for perfect picturesqueness—too
uncontrasted with the profane architecture
of the human homes for which it pleads to the
skies. But Wells is in fact not a city with a cathedral
for central feature; it is a cathedral with a
little city gathered at the base and forming hardly
more than an extension of the spacious close. You
feel everywhere the presence of the beautiful church;
the place seems always to savour of a Sunday afternoon;
and you imagine every house tenanted by
a canon, a prebendary, or a precentor, with “backs”
providing for choristers and vergers.

The great façade is remarkable not so much for
its expanse as for its elaborate elegance. It consists
of two great truncated towers, divided by a broad
centre bearing, beside its rich fretwork of statues,
three narrow lancet windows. The statues on this
vast front are the great boast of the cathedral. They
number, with the lateral figures of the towers, no
less than three hundred; it seems densely embroidered
by the chisel. They are disposed, in successive
niches, along six main vertical shafts; the central
windows are framed and divided by narrower shafts,
and the wall above them rises into a pinnacled screen
traversed by two superb horizontal rows. Add to
these a close-running cornice of images along the
line corresponding with the summit of the aisles and
the tiers which complete the decoration of the towers
on either side, and you have an immense system of
images governed by a quaint theological order and
most impressive in its completeness. Many of the
little high-lodged effigies are mutilated, and not
a few of the niches are empty, but the injury of time
is not sufficient to diminish the noble serenity of the
building. The injury of time is indeed being actively
repaired, for the front is partly masked by
a slender scaffolding. The props and platforms are
of the most delicate structure, and look in fact as if
they were meant to facilitate no more ponderous
labour than a fitting-on of noses to disfeatured
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110" name="Page_110" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_110">110</a></span>
bishops and a rearrangement of the mantle-folds of
strait-laced queens discomposed by the centuries.
The main beauty of Wells Cathedral, to my mind,
is not its more or less visible wealth of detail, but its
singularly charming tone of colour. An even, sober,
mouse-like grey invests it from summit to base,
deepening nowhere to the melancholy black of your
truly romantic gothic, but showing as yet none
of the spotty brightness of renovation. It is a wonderful
fact that the great towers, from their lofty
outlook, see never a factory chimney—those cloud-compelling
spires which so often break the charm
of the softest English horizons; and the general
atmosphere of Wells seemed to me, for some reason,
peculiarly luminous and sweet. The cathedral has
never been discoloured by the moral malaria of a city
with an independent secular life. As you turn back
from its portal and glance at the open lawn before
it, edged by the mild grey seventeenth-century
deanery and the other dwellings, hardly less stately,
which seem to reflect in their comfortable fronts the
rich respectability of the church, and then up again
at the beautiful clear-hued pile, you may fancy it
less a temple for man’s needs than a monument of
his pride—less a fold for the flock than for the
shepherds; a visible token that, besides the actual
assortment of heavenly thrones, there is constantly
on hand a “full line” of cushioned cathedral stalls.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111" name="Page_111" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_111">111</a></span>
Within the cathedral this impression is not diminished.
The interior is vast and massive, but it lacks
incident—the incident of monuments, sepulchres,
and chapels—and it is too brilliantly lighted for
picturesque, as distinguished from strictly architectural,
interest. Under this latter head it has, I believe,
great importance. For myself, I can think of
it only as I saw it from my place in the choir during
afternoon service of a hot Sunday. The Bishop
sat facing me, enthroned in a stately gothic alcove
and clad in his crimson band, his lawn sleeves and
his lavender gloves; the canons, in their degree, with
still other priestly forms, reclined comfortably in the
carven stalls, and the scanty congregation fringed
the broad aisle. But though scanty, the congregation
was select; it was unexceptionably black-coated,
bonneted and gloved. It savoured intensely
in short of that inexorable gentility which the English
put on with their Sunday bonnets and beavers,
and which fills me—as a mere taster of produced
tastes—with a sort of fond reactionary remembrance
of those animated bundles of rags which one
sees kneeling in the churches of Italy. But even
here, as taster of tastes, I found my account. You
always do if you throw yourself confidently enough,
in England, on the chapter of accidents. Before me
and beside me sat a row of the comeliest young men,
clad in black gowns and wearing on their shoulders
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112" name="Page_112" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_112">112</a></span>
long hoods trimmed with white fur. Who and what
they were I know not, for I preferred not to learn,
lest by chance they should not be so mediæval as
they looked.

<p>
My fancy found its account even better in the
singular quaintness of the little precinct known as
the Vicars’ Close. It directly adjoins the Cathedral
Green, and you enter it beneath one of the solid old
gate-houses which form so striking an element in
the ecclesiastical furniture of Wells. It consists of
a narrow, oblong court, bordered on each side with
thirteen small dwellings and terminating in a ruinous
little chapel. Here formerly dwelt a congregation of
minor priests, established in the thirteenth century
to do curates’ work for the canons. The little houses
are very much modernised; but they retain their
tall chimneys, with carven tablets in the face, their
antique compactness and neatness, and a certain
little sanctified air as of cells in a cloister. The place
is adorably of another world and time, and, approaching
it as I did in the first dimness of twilight,
it looked to me, in its exaggerated perspective, like
one of those conventional streets represented on the
stage, down whose impossible vista the heroes and
confidants of romantic comedies come swaggering
arm-in-arm and hold amorous converse with heroines
perched at second-story windows. But though
the Vicars’ Close is a curious affair enough, the

great boast of Wells is its episcopal Palace. The
Palace loses nothing from being seen for the first
time in the kindly twilight, and from being approached
with an uncautioned mind. To reach it
(unless you go from within the cathedral by the
cloisters), you pass out of the Green by another
ancient gateway into the market-place, and thence
back again through its own peculiar portal. My own
first glimpse of it had all the felicity of a <i>coup de
théâtre</i>. I saw within the dark archway an enclosure
bedimmed at once with the shadows of trees and
heightened with the glitter of water. The picture
was worthy of this agreeable promise. Its main
feature is the little grey-walled island on which the
Palace stands, rising in feudal fashion out of a
broad, clear moat, flanked with round towers and
approached by a proper drawbridge. Along the
outer side of the moat is a short walk beneath a row
of picturesquely stunted elms; swans and ducks disport
themselves in the current and ripple the bright
shadows of the overclambering plants from the episcopal
gardens and masses of wall-flower lodged on
the hoary battlements. On the evening of my visit
the haymakers were at work on a great sloping field
in the rear of the Palace, and the sweet perfume of
the tumbled grass in the dusky air seemed all that
was wanting to fix the scene for ever in the memory.
Beyond the moat and within the grey walls dwells
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114" name="Page_114" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_114">114</a></span>
my lord Bishop, in the finest seat of all his order.
The mansion dates from the thirteenth century; but,
stately dwelling though it is, it occupies but a subordinate
place in its own grounds. Their great ornament,
picturesquely speaking, is the massive ruin
of a banqueting-hall erected by a free-living mediæval
bishop and more or less demolished at the
Reformation. With its still perfect towers and beautiful
shapely windows, hung with those green tapestries
so stoutly woven by the English climate, it is
a relic worthy of being locked away behind an
embattled wall. I have among my impressions of
Wells, besides this picture of the moated Palace,
half a dozen memories of the romantic sort, which
I lack space to transcribe. The clearest impression
perhaps is that of the beautiful church of St. Cuthbert,
of the same date as the cathedral, and in very
much the same style of elegant, temperate early
English. It wears one of the high-soaring towers for
which Somersetshire is justly celebrated, as you may
see from the window of the train in rolling past its
almost topheavy hamlets. The beautiful old church,
surrounded with its green graveyard, and large
enough to be impressive, without being too large
(a great merit, to my sense) to be easily compassed
by a deplorably unarchitectural eye, wore a native
English expression to which certain humble figures
in the foreground gave additional point. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115" name="Page_115" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_115">115</a></span>
edge of the churchyard was a low-gabled house,
before which four old men were gossiping in the
eventide. Into the front of the house was inserted
an antique alcove in stone, divided into three shallow
little seats, two of which were occupied by extraordinary
specimens of decrepitude. One of these
ancient paupers had a huge protuberant forehead,
and sat with a pensive air, his head gathered painfully
upon his twisted shoulders and his legs resting
across his crutch. The other was rubicund, blear-eyed,
and frightfully besmeared with snuff. Their
voices were so feeble and senile that I could scarcely
understand them, and only just managed to make
out the answer to my enquiry of who and what they
were—“We’re Still’s Almhouse, sir.”

<p>
One of the lions, almost, of Wells (whence it is but
five miles distant) is the ruin of the famous Abbey of
Glastonbury, on which Henry VIII, in the language
of our day, came down so heavily. The ancient splendour
of the architecture survives but in scattered and
scanty fragments, among influences of a rather inharmonious
sort. It was cattle-market in the little town
as I passed up the main street, and a savour of hoofs
and hide seemed to accompany me through the easy
labyrinth of the old arches and piers. These occupy
a large back yard, close behind the street, to which
you are most prosaically admitted by a young woman
who keeps a wicket and sells tickets. The continuity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116" name="Page_116" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_116">116</a></span>
of tradition is not altogether broken, however, for
the little street of Glastonbury has rather an old-time
aspect, and one of the houses at least must have
seen the last of the abbots ride abroad on his mule.
The little inn is a capital bit of character, and as
I waited for the ’bus under its low dark archway (in
something of the mood, possibly, in which a train
was once waited for at Coventry), and watched
the barmaid flirting her way to and fro out of the
heavy-browed kitchen and among the lounging
young appraisers of colts and steers and barmaids,
I might have imagined that the merry England of
the Tudors had not utterly passed away. A beautiful
England this must have been as well, if it contained
many such abbeys as Glastonbury. Such of
the ruined columns and portals and windows as still
remain are of admirable design and finish. The
doorways are rich in marginal ornament—ornament
within ornament, as it often is; for the dainty
weeds and wild flowers overlace the antique tracery
with their bright arabesques and deepen the grey
of the stonework as it brightens their bloom. The
thousand flowers which grow among English ruins
deserve a chapter to themselves. I owe them, as an
observer, a heavy debt of satisfaction, but I am too
little of a botanist to pay them in their own coin. It
has often seemed to me in England that the purest
enjoyment of architecture was to be had among the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117" name="Page_117" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_117">117</a></span>
ruins of great buildings. In the perfect building one
is rarely sure that the impression is simply architectural:
it is more or less pictorial and romantic;
it depends partly upon association and partly upon
various accessories and details which, however they
may be wrought into harmony with the architectural
idea, are not part of its essence and spirit. But in so
far as beauty of structure is beauty of line and curve,
balance and harmony of masses and dimensions,
I have seldom relished it as deeply as on the grassy
nave of some crumbling church, before lonely columns
and empty windows where the wild flowers
were a cornice and the sailing clouds a roof. The
arts certainly hang together in what they do for us.
These hoary relics of Glastonbury reminded me in
their broken eloquence of one of the other great
ruins of the world—the Last Supper of Leonardo.
A beautiful shadow, in each case, is all that remains;
but that shadow is the soul of the artist.

<p class="caption">SALISBURY CATHEDRAL</p>
</div>

<p>
Salisbury Cathedral, to which I made a pilgrimage
on leaving Wells, is the very reverse of a ruin,
and you take your pleasure there on very different
grounds from those I have just attempted to define.
It is perhaps the best-known typical church in
the world, thanks to its shapely spire; but the spire
is so simply and obviously fair that when you have
respectfully made a note of it you have anticipated
æsthetic analysis. I had seen it before and admired
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118" name="Page_118" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_118">118</a></span>
it heartily, and perhaps I should have done as well
to let my admiration rest. I confess that on repeated
inspection it grew to seem to me the least bit <i>banal</i>,
or even <i>bête</i>, since I am talking French, and I began
to consider whether it does not belong to the same
range of art as the Apollo Belvedere or the Venus
de’ Medici. I am inclined to think that if I had to
live within sight of a cathedral and encounter it in
my daily comings and goings, I should grow less
weary of the rugged black front of Exeter than of the
sweet perfection of Salisbury. There are people by
temperament easily sated with beauties specifically
fair, and the effect of Salisbury Cathedral architecturally
is equivalent to that of flaxen hair and blue
eyes physiognomically. The other lions of Salisbury,
Stonehenge and Wilton House, I revisited with undiminished
interest. Stonehenge is rather a hackneyed
shrine of pilgrimage. At the time of my former
visit a picnic-party was making libations of beer on
the dreadful altar-sites. But the mighty mystery of
the place has not yet been stared out of countenance;
and as on this occasion there were no picnickers we
were left to drink deep of all its ambiguities and
intensities. It stands as lonely in history as it does
on the great plain whose many-tinted green waves,
as they roll away from it, seem to symbolise the ebb
of the long centuries which have left it so portentously
unexplained. You may put a hundred questions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119" name="Page_119" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_119">119</a></span>
to these rough-hewn giants as they bend in
grim contemplation of their fallen companions; but
your curiosity falls dead in the vast sunny stillness
that enshrouds them, and the strange monument,
with all its unspoken memories, becomes simply
a heart-stirring picture in a land of pictures. It is
indeed immensely vague and immensely deep. At
a distance you see it standing in a shallow dell of the
plain, looking hardly larger than a group of ten-pins
on a bowling-green. I can fancy sitting all a summer’s
day watching its shadows shorten and lengthen
again, and drawing a delicious contrast between the
world’s duration and the feeble span of individual
experience. There is something in Stonehenge almost
reassuring to the nerves; if you are disposed to
feel that the life of man has rather a thin surface,
and that we soon get to the bottom of things, the
immemorial grey pillars may serve to represent for
you the pathless vaults beneath the house of history.
Salisbury is indeed rich in antiquities. Wilton House,
a delightful old residence of the Earls of Pembroke,
contains a noble collection of Greek and Roman
marbles. These are ranged round a charming cloister
occupying the centre of the house, which is
exhibited in the most liberal fashion. Out of the
cloister opens a series of drawing-rooms hung with
family portraits, chiefly by Vandyck, all of superlative
merit. Among them hangs supreme, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120" name="Page_120" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_120">120</a></span>
Vandyck <i>par excellence</i>, the famous and magnificent
group of the whole Pembroke family of James the
First’s time. This splendid work has every pictorial
merit—design, colour, elegance, force, and finish,
and I have been vainly wondering to this hour what
it needs to be the finest piece of portraiture, as it
surely is one of the most ambitious, in the world.
What it lacks, characteristically, in a certain uncompromising
veracity, it recovers in the beautiful
dignity of its position—unmoved from the stately
house in which its author sojourned and wrought,
familiar to the descendants of its noble originals.

AN ENGLISH EASTER

<h3 class="lowpad">
I
</h3>

<p>
It may be said of the English, as is said of the
council of war in Sheridan’s farce of “The
Critic” by one of the spectators of the rehearsal,
that when they <i>do</i> agree, their unanimity is wonderful.
They differ among themselves greatly just now
as regards the machinations of Russia, the derelictions
of Turkey, the merits of the Reverend Arthur
Tooth, the genius of Mr. Henry Irving, and a good
many other matters; but neither just now nor at
any other time do they fail to conform to those social
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122" name="Page_122" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_122">122</a></span>
observances on which respectability has set her seal.
England is a country of curious anomalies, and this
has much to do with her being so interesting to foreign
observers. The national, the individual character
is very positive, very independent, very much
made up according to its own sentiment of things,
very prone to startling eccentricities; and yet at the
same time it has beyond any other this peculiar
gift of squaring itself with fashion and custom. In
no other country, I imagine, are so many people to
be found doing the same thing in the same way at
the same time—using the same slang, wearing the
same hats and neckties, collecting the same china-plates,
playing the same game of lawn-tennis or of
polo, admiring the same professional beauty. The
monotony of such a spectacle would soon become
oppressive if the foreign observer were not conscious
of this latent capacity in the performers for
great freedom of action; he finds a good deal of entertainment
in wondering how they reconcile the traditional
insularity of the private person with this perpetual
tribute to usage. Of course in all civilised
societies the tribute to usage is constantly paid; if
it is less apparent in America than elsewhere the
reason is not, I think, because individual independence
is greater, but because usage is more sparsely
established. Where custom can be ascertained people
certainly follow it; but for one definite precedent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123" name="Page_123" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_123">123</a></span>
in American life there are fifty in English. I am
very far from having discovered the secret; I have
not in the least learned what becomes of that
explosive personal force in the English character
which is compressed and corked down by social
conformity. I look with a certain awe at some of
the manifestations of the conforming spirit, but the
fermenting idiosyncrasies beneath it are hidden from
my vision. The most striking example, to foreign
eyes, of the power of custom in England is certainly
the universal church-going. In the sight of
the English people getting up from its tea and toast
of a Sunday morning and brushing its hat, and
drawing on its gloves, and taking its wife on its arm,
and making its offspring march before, and so, for
decency’s, respectability’s, propriety’s sake, wending
its way to a place of worship appointed by the
State, which it repeats the formulas of a creed to
which it attaches no positive sense and listens to a
sermon over the length of which it explicitly haggles
and grumbles—in this exhibition there is something
very impressive to a stranger, something which he
hardly knows whether to estimate as a great force
or as a great futility. He inclines on the whole
to pronounce the spectacle sublime, because it
gives him the feeling that whenever it may become
necessary for a people trained in these manœuvres
to move all together under a common direction,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124" name="Page_124" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_124">124</a></span>
they will have it in them to do so with tremendous
weight and cohesiveness. We hear a good deal about
the effect of the Prussian military system in consolidating
the German people and making them
available for a particular purpose; but I really
think it not fanciful to say that the military punctuality
which characterises the English observance of
Sunday ought to be appreciated in the same fashion.
A nation which has passed through such a mill will
certainly have been stamped by it. And here, as in
the German military service, it is really the whole
nation. When I spoke just now of paterfamilias
and his <i>entourage</i> I did not mean to limit the statement
to him. The young unmarried men go to
church, the gay bachelors, the irresponsible members
of society. (That last epithet must be taken with a
grain of allowance. No one in England is literally
irresponsible; that perhaps is the shortest way of
expressing a stranger’s, certainly an American’s,
sense of their cohesion. Every one is free and every
one is responsible. To say what it is people are
responsible <i>to</i> is of course a great extension of the
question: briefly, to social expectation, to propriety,
to morality, to “position,” to the conventional English
conscience, which is, after all, such a powerful
factor. With us there is infinitely less responsibility;
but there is also, I think, less freedom.)

luxurious classes imposes itself upon the less luxurious
may of course be noticed in smaller matters
than church-going; in a great many matters which
it may seem trivial to mention. If one is bent upon
observation nothing, however, is trivial. So I may
cite the practice of banishing the servants from the
room at breakfast. It is the fashion, and accordingly,
through the length and breadth of England,
every one who has the slightest pretension to standing
high enough to feel the way the social breeze
is blowing conforms to it. It is awkward, unnatural,
troublesome for those at table, it involves a vast
amount of leaning and stretching, of waiting and
perambulating, and it has just that vice against
which, in English history, all great movements have
been made—it is arbitrary. But it flourishes for
all that, and all genteel people, looking into each
other’s eyes with the desperation of gentility, agree
to endure it for gentility’s sake. My instance may
seem feeble, and I speak honestly when I say I
might give others, forming part of an immense body
of prescriptive usage, to which a society possessing
in the largest manner, both by temperament and
education, the sense of the “inalienable” rights and
comforts of the individual, contrives to accommodate
itself. I do not mean to say that usage in England
is always uncomfortable and arbitrary. On the
contrary, few strangers can be unfamiliar with that

sensation (a most agreeable one) which consists in
perceiving in the rigidity of a tradition which has
struck one at first as mechanical a reason existing
in the historic “good sense” of the English race.
The sensation is frequent, though in saying so I do
not mean to imply that even superficially the presumption
is against the usages of English society.
It is not, for instance, necessarily against the custom
of which I had it more especially in mind to speak
in writing these lines. The stranger in London is
forewarned that at Easter all the world goes out of
town, and that if he have no mind to be left to some
fate the universal terror of which half allures half
appals his curiosity, he too had better make arrangements
for a temporary absence. It must be admitted
that there is a sort of unexpectedness in this prompt
re-emigration of a body of people who but a week
before were apparently devoting much energy to
settling down for the season. Half of them have but
lately come back from the country, where they have
been spending the winter, and they have just had
time, it may be supposed, to collect the scattered
threads of town-life. Presently, however, the threads
are dropped and society is dispersed as if it had
taken a false start. It departs as Holy Week draws
to a close, and remains absent for the following ten
days. Where it goes is its own affair; a good deal
of it goes to Paris. Spending last winter in that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127" name="Page_127" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_127">127</a></span>
city, I remember how, when I woke up on Easter
Monday and looked out of my window, I found the
street covered overnight with a sort of snow-fall of
disembarked Britons. They made for other people
an uncomfortable week of it. One’s customary table
at the restaurant, one’s habitual stall at the Théâtre
Français, one’s usual fiacre on the cab-stand, were
very apt to have suffered estrangement. I believe
the pilgrimage to Paris was this year of the usual
proportions; and you may be sure that people who
did not cross the Channel were not without invitations
to quiet old places in the country, where the
pale fresh primroses were beginning to light up the
dark turf and the purple bloom of the bare tree-masses
to be freckled here and there with verdure.
In England country-life is the obverse of the medal,
town-life the reverse, and when an occasion comes
for quitting London there are few members of
what the French call the “easy class” who have not
a collection of dull, moist, verdant resorts to choose
from. Dull I call them, and I fancy not without
reason, though at the moment I speak of their dulness
must have been mitigated by the unintermittent
presence of the keenest and liveliest of east winds.
Even in mellow English country homes Easter-tide
is a period of rawness and atmospheric acridity—the
moment at which the frank hostility of winter,
which has at last to give up the game, turns to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128" name="Page_128" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_128">128</a></span>
peevishness and spite. This is what makes it arbitrary,
as I said just now, for “easy” people to go
forth to the wind-swept lawns and the shivering
parks. But nothing is more striking to an American
than the frequency of English holidays and the large
way in which occasions for “a little change” are
made use of. All this speaks to Americans of three
things which they are accustomed to see allotted in
scantier measure. The English have more time
than we, they have more money, and they have a
much higher relish for active leisure. Leisure,
fortune, and the love of sport are felicities encountered
in English society at every turn. It was
a very small number of weeks before Easter that
Parliament met, and yet a ten days’ recess was
already, from the luxurious Parliamentary point of
view, a necessity. A short time hence we shall be
having the Whitsuntide holidays, which I am told
are even more of a season of revelry than Easter,
and from this point to midsummer, when everything
stops, is an easy journey. The men of business and
the professional men partake in equal measure of
these agreeable diversions, and I was interested in
hearing a lady whose husband was an active member
of the bar say that, though he was leaving town
with her for ten days, and though Easter was a very
nice “little break,” they really amused themselves
more during the later festival, which would come
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129" name="Page_129" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_129">129</a></span>
on toward the end of May. I thought this highly
probable, and admired in their career such an effect
of breeze-blown light and shade. If my phrase has
a slightly ironical sound, this is purely accidental.
A large appetite for holidays, the ability not only to
take them but to know what to do with them when
taken, is the sign of a robust people, and judged
by this measure we Americans are sadly inexpert.
Such holidays as we take are taken very often in
Europe, where it is sometimes noticeable that our
privilege is rather heavy on our hands. Acknowledgment
made of English industry, however (our own
stands in no need of compliments), it must be added
that for those same easy classes I just spoke of things
are very easy indeed. The number of persons obtainable
for purely social purposes at all times and
seasons is infinitely greater than among ourselves;
and the ingenuity of the arrangements permanently
going forward to disembarrass them of their superfluous
leisure is as yet in America an undeveloped
branch of civilisation. The young men who are
preparing for the stern realities of life among the
grey-green cloisters of Oxford are obliged to keep
their terms but half the year; and the rosy little
cricketers of Eton and Harrow are let loose upon
the parental home for an embarrassing number of
months. Happily the parental home is apt to be an
affair of gardens, lawns, and parks.

<h3>
II

<p>
Passion Week, in London, is distinctly an ascetic
period; there is really an approach to sackcloth and
ashes. Private dissipation is suspended; most of
the theatres and music-halls are closed; the huge
dusky city seems to take on a still sadder colouring
and a half-hearted hush steals over its mighty uproar.
At such a moment, for a stranger, London is
not cheerful. Arriving there, during the past winter,
about Christmas-time, I encountered three British
Sundays in a row—a spectacle to strike terror into
the stoutest heart. A Sunday and a “bank-holiday,”
if I remember aright, had joined hands with a Christmas
Day and produced the portentous phenomenon
to which I allude. I betrayed, I suppose, some apprehension
of its oppressive character, for I remember
being told in a consolatory way that I needn’t
fear; it would not come round again for another
year. This information was given me on the occasion
of that surprising interruption of one’s relations
with the laundress which is apparently characteristic
of the period. I was told that all the washerwomen
were intoxicated and that, as it would take them
some time to revive, I must not count upon a relay
of “fresh things.” I shall not forget the impression
made upon me by this statement; I had just come
from Paris and it almost sent me spinning back.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131" name="Page_131" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_131">131</a></span>
One of the incidental <i>agréments</i> of life in the latter
city had been the knock at my door on Saturday
evenings of a charming young woman with a large
basket protected by a snowy napkin on her arm, and
on her head a frilled and fluted muslin cap which
was an irresistible advertisement of her art. To say
that my admirable <i>blanchisseuse</i> was not in liquor
is altogether too gross a compliment; but I was always
grateful to her for her russet cheek, her frank
expressive eye, her talkative smile, for the way her
charming cap was poised upon her crisp, dense hair
and her well-made dress adjusted and worn. I
talked with her; I <i>could</i> talk with her; and as she
talked she moved about and laid out her linen with
a delightful modest ease. Then her light step carried
her off again, talking, to the door, and with a brighter
smile and an “Adieu, monsieur!” she closed it behind
her, leaving one to think how stupid is prejudice
and how poetic a creature a washerwoman may
be. London, in December, was livid with sleet and
fog, and against this dismal background was offered
me the vision of a horrible old woman in a smoky
bonnet, lying prone in a puddle of whiskey! She
seemed to assume a kind of symbolic significance
and almost frightened me away.

<p>
I mention this trifle, which is doubtless not
creditable to my fortitude, because I found that the
information given me was not strictly accurate and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132" name="Page_132" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_132">132</a></span>
that at the end of three months I had another array
of London Sundays to face. On this occasion, however,
nothing occurred to suggest again the dreadful
image I have just sketched, though I devoted a good
deal of time to observing the manners of the lower
orders. From Good Friday to Easter Monday, inclusive,
they were very much <i>en évidence</i>, and it was
an excellent occasion for getting an impression of
the British populace. Gentility had retired to the
background, and in the West End all the blinds were
lowered; the streets were void of carriages, and well-dressed
pedestrians were rare; but the “masses”
were all abroad and making the most of their holiday,
so that I strolled about and watched them at
their gambols. The heavens were most unfavourable,
but in an English “outing” there is always a margin
left for a drenching, and throughout the vast smoky
city, beneath the shifting gloom of the sky, the
grimy crowds wandered with a kind of weatherproof
stolidity. The parks were full of them, the
railway stations overflowed, the Thames embankment
was covered. The “masses,” I think, are
usually an entertaining spectacle, even when observed
through the distorting medium of London
bad weather. There are indeed few things in their
way more impressive than a dusky London holiday;
it suggests so many and such interestingly related
reflections. Even looked at superficially the capital
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133" name="Page_133" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_133">133</a></span>
of the Empire is one of the most appealing of cities,
and it is perhaps on such occasions as this that
I have most felt its appeal. London is ugly, dusky,
dreary, more destitute than any European city of
graceful and decorative incident; and though on
festal days, like those I speak of, the populace is
massed in large numbers at certain points, many
of the streets are empty enough of human life to
enable you to perceive their intrinsic want of charm.
A Christmas Day or a Good Friday uncovers the
ugliness of London. As you walk along the streets,
having no fellow pedestrians to look at, you look up
at the brown brick house-walls, corroded with soot
and fog, pierced with their straight stiff window-slits,
and finished, by way of a cornice, with a little black
line resembling a slice of curbstone. There is not
an accessory, not a touch of architectural fancy,
not the narrowest concession to beauty. If I were
a foreigner it would make me rabid; being an Anglo-Saxon
I find in it what Thackeray found in Baker
Street—a delightful proof of English domestic
virtue, of the sanctity of the British home. There
are miles and miles of these edifying monuments,
and it would seem that a city made up of them should
have no claim to that larger effectiveness of which
I just now spoke. London, however, is not made
up of them; there are architectural combinations of
a statelier kind, and the impression moreover does
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134" name="Page_134" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_134">134</a></span>
not rest on details. London is pictorial in spite of
details—from its dark-green, misty parks, the way
the light comes down leaking and filtering from its
cloud-ceiling, and the softness and richness of tone
which objects put on in such an atmosphere as soon
as they begin to recede. Nowhere is there such
a play of light and shade, such a struggle of sun and
smoke, such aërial gradations and confusions. To
eyes addicted to such contemplations this is a constant
diversion, and yet this is only part of it. What
completes the effect of the place is its appeal to the
feelings, made in so many ways, but made above all
by agglomerated immensity. At any given point
London looks huge; even in narrow corners you
have a sense of its hugeness, and petty places acquire
a certain interest from their being parts of so
mighty a whole. Nowhere else is so much human
life gathered together, and nowhere does it press
upon you with so many suggestions. These are not
all of an exhilarating kind; far from it. But they are
of every possible kind, and that is the interest of
London. Those that were most forcible during the
showery Easter season were certain of the more
perplexing and depressing ones; but even with
these was mingled a brighter strain.

I walked down to Westminster Abbey on Good
Friday afternoon—walked from Piccadilly across
the Green Park and through that of St. James. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135" name="Page_135" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_135">135</a></span>
parks were densely filled with the populace—the
elder people shuffling about the walks and the poor
little smutty-faced children sprawling over the dark
damp turf. When I reached the Abbey, I found
a dense group of people about the entrance, but
I squeezed my way through them and succeeded in
reaching the threshold. Beyond this it was impossible
to advance, and I may add that it was not desirable.
I put my nose into the church and promptly
withdrew it. The crowd was terribly compact, and
beneath the gothic arches the odour was not that
of incense. I gradually gave it up, with that very
modified sense of disappointment that one feels in
London at being crowded out of a place. This is
a frequent form of philosophy, for you soon learn
that there are, selfishly speaking, too many people.
Human life is cheap; your fellow mortals are too
numerous. Wherever you go you make the observation.
At the theatre, at a concert, an exhibition,
a reception, you always find that, before you arrive,
there are people enough in the field. You are a tight
fit in your place, wherever you find it; you have
too many companions and competitors. You feel
yourself at times in danger of thinking meanly of
the human personality; numerosity, as it were,
swallows up quality, and the perpetual sense of
other elbows and knees begets a yearning for the
desert. This is the reason why the perfection of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136" name="Page_136" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_136">136</a></span>
luxury in England is to own a “park”—an artificial
solitude. To get one’s self into the middle of a few
hundred acres of oak-studded turf and to keep off
the crowd by the breadth, at least, of the grassy
shade, is to enjoy a comfort which circumstances
make peculiarly precious. But I walked back
through the profane pleasure-grounds of London,
in the midst of “superfluous herds,” and I found
the profit of vision that I never fail to derive from
a great English assemblage. The English are, on
the whole, to my eyes so appreciably the handsomest
people in Europe—remembering always, of course,
that when we talk of the frequency of beauty anywhere
we talk of a minor quantity, more small or
less small—that it takes some effort of the imagination
to believe that the appearance requires demonstration.
I never see a large number of them without
feeling this impression confirmed; though I hasten
to add that I have sometimes felt it to be much
shaken in the presence of a limited group. I suspect
that a great English crowd would yield a larger
percentage of <i>regular</i> faces and tall figures than any
other. With regard to the upper class, I suppose
this is generally granted; but, with all abatements,
I should extend it to the people at large. Certainly,
if the English populace strike the observer as regular,
nature, in them, must have clung hard to the
higher ideal. They are as ill-dressed as their betters
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137" name="Page_137" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_137">137</a></span>
are well-dressed, and their garments have that sooty
surface which has nothing in common with the
continental costume of labour and privation. It is
the hard prose of misery—an ugly and hopeless
imitation of respectable attire. This is especially
noticeable in the battered and bedraggled bonnets
of the women, which look as if their husbands had
stamped on them, in hobnailed boots, as a hint of
what may be in store for their wearers. Then it is
not too much to say that two thirds of the London
faces, as the streets present them, bear in some
degree or other the traces of alcoholic action. The
proportion of flushed, empurpled, eruptive masks is
considerable; a source of depression, for the spectator,
not diminished by the fact that many of the
faces thus disfigured have evidently been planned
on lines of high superficial decency. A very large
allowance is to be made, too, for the people who
bear the distinctive stamp of that physical and mental
degradation which comes from the slums and
purlieus of this duskiest of modern Babylons—the
pallid, stunted, misbegotten and in every way miserable
figures. These people swarm in every London
crowd, and I know of none in any other place that
suggest an equal depth of degradation. But when
such exceptions are taken the observer still notes
the quantity and degree of facial finish, the firmness
of type, if not always its fineness, the clearnesses and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138" name="Page_138" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_138">138</a></span>
symmetries, the modelled brows and cheeks and
chins, the immense contribution made to his impression,
above all, by the elements of complexion
and stature. The question of expression is another
matter, and one must admit at the outset, to have
done with it, that expression here in general lacks,
even to strangeness, any perceptible intensity,
though it often has among the women, and adorably
among the children, an indescribable shy delicacy.
I have it at heart, however, to add that if the English
are handsomer than ourselves they are also very
much uglier. Indeed I think all the European peoples
more richly ugly than the American: we are far
from producing those magnificent types of facial eccentricity
which flourish on soils socially more rank.
American ugliness is on the side of physical poverty
and meanness; English on that of redundancy and
monstrosity. In America there are few grotesques;
in England there are many—and some of them
have a high plastic, historic, romantic value.
</p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
The element of the grotesque was very noticeable
to me in the most marked collection of the shabbier
English types that I had seen since I came to London.
The occasion of my seeing them was the
funeral of Mr. George Odger, which befell some four
or five weeks before the Easter period. Mr. George
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139" name="Page_139" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_139">139</a></span>
Odger, it will perhaps be remembered, was an English
radical agitator of humble origin, who had distinguished
himself by a perverse desire to get into
Parliament. He exercised, I believe, the useful profession
of shoemaker, and he knocked in vain at the
door that opens but to the refined. But he was a useful
and honourable man, and his own people gave him
an honourable burial. I emerged accidentally into
Piccadilly at the moment they were so engaged, and
the spectacle was one I should have been sorry to
miss. The crowd was enormous, but I managed to
squeeze through it and to get into a hansom cab
that was drawn up beside the pavement, and here I
looked on as from a box at the play. Though it was
a funeral that was going on I will not call it a tragedy;
but it was a very serious comedy. The day
happened to be magnificent—the finest of the year.
The ceremony had been taken in hand by the classes
who are socially unrepresented in Parliament, and
it had the character of a great popular manifestation.
The hearse was followed by very few carriages,
but the <i>cortège</i> of pedestrians stretched away in the
sunshine, up and down the classic decorum of Piccadilly,
on a scale highly impressive. Here and there
the line was broken by a small brass band—apparently
one of those bands of itinerant Germans that
play for coppers beneath lodging-house windows;
but for the rest it was compactly made up of what
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140" name="Page_140" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_140">140</a></span>
the newspapers call the dregs of the population. It
was the London rabble, the metropolitan mob, men
and women, boys and girls, the decent poor and
the indecent, who had scrambled into the ranks as
they gathered them up on their passage, and were
making a sort of solemn “lark” of it. Very solemn
it all was—perfectly proper and undemonstrative.
They shuffled along in an interminable line, and
as I looked at them out of the front of my hansom
I seemed to be having a sort of panoramic view of
the under side, the wrong side, of the London world.
The procession was filled with figures which seemed
never to have “shown out,” as the English say,
before; of strange, pale, mouldy paupers who
blinked and stumbled in the Piccadilly sunshine. I
have no space to describe them more minutely, but
I found the whole affair vaguely yet portentously
suggestive. My impression rose not simply from the
radical, or, as I may say for the sake of colour, the
revolutionary, emanation of this dingy concourse,
lighted up by the ironic sky; but from the same
causes I had observed a short time before, on the day
the Queen went to open Parliament, when in Trafalgar
Square, looking straight down into Westminster
and over the royal procession, were gathered a group
of banners and festoons inscribed in big staring letters
with mottoes and sentiments which might easily
have given on the nerves of a sensitive police department.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141" name="Page_141" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_141">141</a></span>
They were mostly in allusion to the Tichborne
claimant, whose release from his dungeon
they peremptorily demanded and whose cruel fate
was taken as a pretext for several sweeping reflections
on the social arrangements of the time and
country. These signals of unreason were allowed to
sun themselves as freely as if they had been the manifestoes
of the Irish Giant or the Oriental Dwarf at a
fair. I had lately come from Paris, where the authorities
have a shorter patience and where revolutionary
placards at the base of the obelisk in the Place de la
Concorde fall in with no recognised scheme—such
is the effect of the whirligig of time—of the grand
style or of monumental decorum. I was therefore
the more struck on both of the occasions I speak of
with the admirable English practice of letting people
alone—with the frank good sense and the frank
good humour and even the frank good taste of it.
It was this that I found impressive as I watched the
manifestation of Mr. Odger’s underfed partisans—the
fact that the mighty mob could march along and
do its errand while the excellent quiet policemen—eternal,
imperturbable, positively loveable reminders
of the national temperament—stood by simply to
see that the channel was kept clear and comfortable.

</div>

<p>
When Easter Monday came it was obvious that
every one (save Mr. Odger’s friends—three or four
million or so) had gone out of town. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142" name="Page_142" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_142">142</a></span>
hardly a pair of shutters in the West End that was
not closed; there was not a bell that it was any use
to pull. The weather was detestable, the rain incessant,
and the fact that all your friends were away
gave you plenty of leisure to reflect that the country
must be the reverse of enlivening. But all your
friends had gone thither (this is the unanimity I
began by talking about), and to restrict as much as
possible the proportions of that game of hide-and-seek
of which, at the best, so much of London social
life consists, it seemed wise to bring within the limits
of the dull season any such excursion as might have
been projected in commemoration of the first days
of spring. After due cogitation I paid a little visit
to Canterbury and Dover, taking Rochester by the
way, and it was of this momentous journey that I
proposed, in beginning these remarks, to give an
account. But I have dallied so much by the way
that I have come almost to my rope’s end without
reaching my first stage. I should have begun, artistically,
by relating that I put myself in the humour
for remote adventure by going down the Thames on
a penny steamboat to the towers of Julius. This was
on the Saturday before Easter, and the City was as
silent as the grave. “London’s lasting shame” was
a memory of my childhood, and, having a theory
that from such memories the dust of the ages had
better not be shaken, I had not retraced my steps to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143" name="Page_143" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_143">143</a></span>
its venerable walls. But the Tower—<i>the</i> Tower—is
very good, and much less cockneyfied than I supposed
it would seem to my maturer vision; very grey
and historical, with the look that vivifies (rather
lividly indeed) the past. I could not get into it, as it
had been closed for Passion Week, but I was consequently
relieved from the obligation to march about
with a dozen fellow starers in the train of a didactic
beef-eater, and I strolled at will through the courts
and the garden, sharing them only with the lounging
soldiers of the garrison, who seemed to connect the
place, for the backward-reaching fancy, with important
events.
</p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
At Rochester I stopped for the sake of its castle,
which I espied from the railway train as it perched
on a grassy bank beside the widening Medway.
There were other beguilements as well; the place
has a small cathedral, and, leaving the creators of
Falstaff and of the tale-telling Pilgrims out of the
question, one had read about it in Dickens, whose
house of Gadshill was a couple of miles from the
town. All this Kentish country, between London
and Dover, figures indeed repeatedly in Dickens;
he expresses to a certain extent, for our later age, the
spirit of the land. I found this to be quite the case at
Rochester. I had occasion to go into a little shop
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144" name="Page_144" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_144">144</a></span>
kept by a talkative old woman who had a photograph
of Gadshill lying on her counter. This led to
my asking her whether the illustrious master of the
house had often, to her old-time vision, made his
appearance in the town. “Oh, bless you, sir,” she
said, “we every one of us knew him to speak to. He
was in this very shop on the Tuesday with a party
of foreigners—as he was dead in his bed on the
Friday.” (I should remark that I probably do not
repeat the days of the week as she gave them.) “He
’ad on his black velvet suit, and it always made him
look so ’andsome. I said to my ’usband, ‘I <i>do</i> think
Charles Dickens looks so nice in that black velvet
suit.’ But he said he couldn’t see as he looked any
way particular. He was in this very shop on the Tuesday,
with a party of foreigners.” Rochester consists
of little more than one long street, stretching away
from the castle and the river toward neighbouring
Chatham, and edged with low brick houses, of intensely
provincial aspect, most of which have some
small, dull smugness or quaintness of gable or window.
Nearly opposite to the shop of the old lady
with the snubby husband is a little dwelling with an
inscribed slab set into its face, which must often have
provoked a smile in the great master of the comic.
The slab relates that in the year 1579 Richard Watts
here established a charity which should furnish “six
poor travellers, not rogues or proctors,” one night’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145" name="Page_145" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_145">145</a></span>
lodging and entertainment gratis, and fourpence in
the morning to go on their way withal, and that in
memory of his “munificence” the stone has lately
been renewed. The inn at Rochester had small
hospitality, and I felt strongly tempted to knock at
the door of Mr. Watts’s asylum, under plea of being
neither a rogue nor a proctor. The poor traveller
who avails himself of the testamentary fourpence
may easily resume his journey as far as Chatham
without breaking his treasure. Is not this the place
where little Davy Copperfield slept under a cannon
on his journey from London to Dover to join his
aunt Miss Trotwood? The two towns are really but
one, which forms an interminable crooked thoroughfare,
lighted up in the dusk, as I measured it up and
down, with the red coats of the vespertinal soldier
quartered at the various barracks of Chatham.

<p class="caption">ROCHESTER CASTLE</p>
</div>

<p>
The cathedral of Rochester is small and plain,
hidden away in rather an awkward corner, without
a verdant close to set it off. It is dwarfed and effaced
by the great square Norman keep of the adjacent
castle. But within it is very charming, especially
beyond the detestable wall, the vice of almost all
the English cathedrals, which shuts in the choir and
breaks the sacred perspective of the aisle. Here, as
at Canterbury, you ascend a high range of steps,
to pass through the small door in the wall. When
I speak slightingly, by the way, of the outside of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146" name="Page_146" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_146">146</a></span>
Rochester cathedral, I intend my faint praise in a
relative sense. If we were so happy as to have this
secondary pile within reach in America we should
go barefoot to see it; but here it stands in the great
shadow of Canterbury, and that makes it humble.
I remember, however, an old priory gateway which
leads you to the church, out of the main street; I
remember a kind of haunted-looking deanery, if that
be the technical name, at the base of the eastern
walls; I remember a fluted tower that took the afternoon
light and let the rooks and the swallows come
circling and clamouring around it. Better still than
these things, I remember the ivy-muffled squareness
of the castle, a very noble and imposing ruin. The
old walled precinct has been converted into a little
public garden, with flowers and benches and a
pavilion for a band, and the place was not empty, as
such places in England never are. The result is
agreeable, but I believe the process was barbarous,
involving the destruction and dispersion of many
interesting portions of the ruin. I lingered there for
a long time, looking in the fading light at what
was left. This rugged pile of Norman masonry will
be left when a great many solid things have departed;
it mocks, ever so monotonously, at destruction,
at decay. Its walls are fantastically thick; their
great time-bleached expanses and all their rounded
roughnesses, their strange mixture of softness and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147" name="Page_147" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_147">147</a></span>
grimness, have an undefinable fascination for the
eye. English ruins always come out peculiarly when
the day begins to fail. Weather-bleached, as I say
they are, they turn even paler in the twilight and
grow consciously solemn and spectral. I have seen
many a mouldering castle, but I remember in no
single mass of ruin more of the helpless, bereaved,
amputated look.

<p>
It is not the absence of a close that damages
Canterbury; the cathedral stands amid grass and
trees, with a cultivated margin all round it, and is
placed in such a way that, as you pass out from
under the gate-house you appreciate immediately its
grand feature—its extraordinary and magnificent
length. None of the English cathedrals seems to sit
more gravely apart, to desire more to be shut up to
itself. It is a long walk, beneath the walls, from the
gateway of the close to the farther end of the last
chapel. Of all that there is to observe in this upward-gazing
stroll I can give no detailed account; I can,
in my fear to pretend to dabble in the esoteric constructional
question—often so combined with an
absence of other felt relations—speak only of the
picture, the mere builded <i>scène</i>. This is altogether
delightful. None of the rivals of Canterbury has a
more complicated and elaborate architecture, a more
perplexing intermixture of periods, a more charming
jumble of Norman arches and English points and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148" name="Page_148" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_148">148</a></span>
perpendiculars. What makes the side-view superb,
moreover, is the double transepts, which produce the
finest agglomeration of gables and buttresses. It is
as if two great churches had joined forces toward the
middle—one giving its nave and the other its choir,
and each keeping its own great cross-aisles. Astride
of the roof, between them, sits a huge gothic tower,
which is one of the latest portions of the building,
though it looks like one of the earliest, so tempered
and tinted, so thumb-marked and rubbed smooth is
it, by the handling of the ages and the breath of the
elements. Like the rest of the structure it has a magnificent
colour—a sort of rich dull yellow, a sort of
personal accent of tone that is neither brown nor
grey. This is particularly appreciable from the
cloisters on the further side of the church—the side,
I mean, away from the town and the open garden-sweep
I spoke of; the side that looks toward a damp
old clerical house, lurking behind a brown archway
through which you see young ladies in Gainsborough
hats playing something on a patch of velvet turf; the
side, in short, that is somehow intermingled with
a green quadrangle—a quadrangle serving as a playground
to a King’s School and adorned externally
with a very precious and picturesque old fragment
of Norman staircase. This cloister is not “kept up;”
it is very dusky and mouldy and dilapidated, and of
course very sketchable. The old black arches and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149" name="Page_149" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_149">149</a></span>
capitals are various and handsome, and in the centre
are tumbled together a group of crooked gravestones,
themselves almost buried in the deep soft grass. Out
of the cloister opens the chapter-house, which is not
kept up either, but which is none the less a magnificent
structure; a noble, lofty hall, with a beautiful
wooden roof, simply arched like that of a tunnel,
without columns or brackets. The place is now
given up to dust and echoes; but it looks more like
a banqueting-hall than a council-room of priests, and
as you sit on the old wooden bench, which, raised on
two or three steps, runs round the base of the four
walls, you may gaze up and make out the faint
ghostly traces of decorative paint and gold upon the
brown ceiling. A little patch of this has been restored
“to give an idea.” From one of the angles of the
cloister you are recommended by the verger to take
a view of the great tower, which indeed detaches
itself with tremendous effect. You see it base itself
upon the roof as broadly as if it were striking roots
in earth, and then pile itself away to a height which
seems to make the very swallows dizzy as they drop
from the topmost shelf. Within the cathedral you
hear a great deal, of course, about poor great
Thomas A’Becket, and the special sensation of the
place is to stand on the spot where he was murdered
and look down at a small fragmentary slab which
the verger points out to you as a bit of the pavement
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150" name="Page_150" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_150">150</a></span>
that caught the blood-drops of the struggle. It was
late in the afternoon when I first entered the church;
there had been a service in the choir, but that was
well over, and I had the place to myself. The verger,
who had some pushing-about of benches to attend
to, turned me into the locked gates and left me to
wander through the side-aisles of the choir and into
the great chapel beyond it. I say I had the place to
myself; but it would be more decent to affirm that
I shared it, in particular, with another gentleman.
This personage was stretched upon a couch of
stone, beneath a quaint old canopy of wood; his
hands were crossed upon his breast, and his pointed
toes rested upon a little griffin or leopard. He was
a very handsome fellow and the image of a gallant
knight. His name was Edward Plantagenet, and
his sobriquet was the Black Prince. “<i>De la mort
ne pensai-je mye</i>,” he says in the beautiful inscription
embossed upon the bronze base of his image;
and I too, as I stood there, lost the sense of death in
a momentary impression of personal nearness to
him. One had been further off, after all, from other
famous knights. In this same chapel, for many a
year, stood the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury,
one of the richest and most potent in Christendom.
The pavement which lay before it has kept its place,
but Henry VIII swept away everything else in his
famous short cut to reform. Becket was originally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151" name="Page_151" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_151">151</a></span>
buried in the crypt of the church; his ashes lay there
for fifty years, and it was only little by little that his
martyrdom was made a “draw.” Then he was
transplanted into the Lady Chapel; every grain of
his dust became a priceless relic, and the pavement
was hallowed by the knees of pilgrims. It was on
this errand of course that Chaucer’s story-telling
cavalcade came to Canterbury. I made my way
down into the crypt, which is a magnificent maze of
low, dark arches and pillars, and groped about till
I found the place where the frightened monks had
first shuffled the inanimate victim of Moreville and
Fitzurse out of the reach of further desecration.
While I stood there a violent thunderstorm broke
over the cathedral; great rumbling gusts and rain-drifts
came sweeping through the open sides of the
crypt and, mingling with the darkness which seemed
to deepen and flash in corners and with the potent
mouldy smell, made me feel as if I had descended
into the very bowels of history. I emerged again, but
the rain had settled down and spoiled the evening,
and I splashed back to my inn and sat, in an uncomfortable
chair by the coffee-room fire, reading Dean
Stanley’s agreeable “Memorials of Canterbury”
and wondering over the musty appointments and
meagre resources of so many English hostels. This
establishment had entitled itself (in compliment to
the Black Prince, I suppose) the “Fleur-de-Lis.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152" name="Page_152" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_152">152</a></span>
The name was very pretty (I had been foolish
enough to let it attract me to the inn), but the lily
was sadly deflowered.

<h2>
LONDON AT MIDSUMMER
</h2>

<p>
I believe it is supposed to require a good deal
of courage to confess that one has spent the
month of so-called social August in London; and
I will therefore, taking the bull by the horns, plead
guilty at the very outset to this poorness of spirit.
I might attempt some ingenious extenuation of it;
I might say that my remaining in town had been the
most unexpected necessity or the merest inadvertence;
I might pretend I liked it—that I had done
it in fact for the perverse love of the thing; I might
claim that you don’t really know the charms of
London until on one of the dog-days you have imprinted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154" name="Page_154" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_154">154</a></span>
your boot-sole in the slumbering dust of
Belgravia, or, gazing along the empty vista of the
Drive, in Hyde Park, have beheld, for almost the
first time in England, a landscape without figures.
But little would remain of these specious apologies
save the bald circumstance that I had distinctly
failed to pack and be off—either on the first of
August with the ladies and children, or on the thirteenth
with the members of Parliament, or on the
twelfth when the grouse-shooting began. (I am not
sure that I have got my dates right to a day, but
these were about the proper opportunities.) I have,
in fact, survived the departure of everything genteel,
and the three millions of persons who remained
behind with me have been witnesses of my shame.
</p>

<p>
I cannot pretend, on the other hand, that, having
lingered in town, I have found it a very odious or
painful experience. Being a stranger, I have not
felt it necessary to incarcerate myself during the
day and steal abroad only under cover of the darkness—a
line of conduct imposed by public opinion,
if I am to trust the social criticism of the weekly
papers (which I am far from doing), upon the native
residents who allow themselves to be overtaken by
the unfashionable season. I have indeed always
held that few things are pleasanter, during very hot
weather, than to have a great city, and a large house
within it, quite to one’s self. Yet these majestic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155" name="Page_155" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_155">155</a></span>
conditions have not embellished my own metropolitan
sojourn, and I have received an impression that
in London it would be rather difficult for a visitor
not having the command of a good deal of powerful
machinery to find them united. English summer
weather is rarely hot enough to make it necessary
to darken one’s house and denude one’s person. The
present year has indeed in this respect been “exceptional,”
as any year is, for that matter, that one
spends anywhere. But the manners of the people
are, to alien eyes, a sufficient indication that at
the best (or the worst) even the highest flights of
the thermometer in the united Kingdom betray a
broken wing. People live with closed windows in
August very much as they do in January, and there
is to the eye no appreciable difference in the character—that
is in the thickness and stiffness—of
their coats and boots. A “bath” in England, for
the most part, all the year round, means a little
portable tin tub and a sponge. Peaches and pears,
grapes and melons, are not a more obvious ornament
of the market at midsummer than at Christmas.
This matter of peaches and melons, by the
way, offers one of the best examples of that fact to
which a commentator on English manners from
afar finds himself constantly recurring, and to which
he grows at last almost ashamed of alluding—the
fact that the beauty and luxury of the country, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156" name="Page_156" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_156">156</a></span>
elaborate system known and revered all over the
world as “English comfort,” is a limited and restricted,
an essentially private, affair. I am not one
of those irreverent strangers who talk of English
fruit as a rather audacious <i>plaisanterie</i>, though I
could see very well what was meant a short time
since by an anecdote related to me in a tone of contemptuous
generalisation by a couple of my fellow
countrywomen. They had arrived in London in the
dog-days, and, lunching at their hotel, had asked
to be served with some fruit. The hotel was of the
stateliest pattern, and they were waited upon by
a functionary whose grandeur was proportionate.
This personage bowed and retired, and, after a long
delay, reappearing, placed before them with an
inimitable gesture a dish of gooseberries and currants.
It appeared upon investigation that these
acrid vegetables were the only things of succulence
that the establishment could undertake to supply;
and it seemed to increase the irony of the situation
that the establishment was as near as possible to
Buckingham Palace. I say that the heroines of my
anecdote seemed disposed to generalise: this was
sufficiently the case, I mean, to give me a pretext
for assuring them that on a thousand fine properties
the most beautiful peaches and melons were at that
moment ripening either under glass or in warm old
walled gardens. My auditors tossed their heads
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157" name="Page_157" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_157">157</a></span>
of course at the fine properties, the glass, and the
walled gardens; and indeed at their place of privation
close to Buckingham Palace such a piece of
knowledge was but scantily consoling.

<p>
It is to a more public fund of entertainment that
the desultory stranger in any country chiefly appeals,
especially in summer weather; and as I have implied
that there is little encouragement in England
to such an appeal it may appear remarkable that
I should not have felt London, at this season, void
of all beguilement. But one’s liking for London—a
stranger’s liking at least—has at the best a kind
of perversity and infirmity often rather difficult to
reduce to a statement. I am far from meaning by
this that there are not in this mighty metropolis
a thousand sources of interest, entertainment, and
delight: what I mean is that, for one reason and
another, with all its social resources, the place lies
heavy on the imported consciousness. It seems grim
and lurid, fierce and unmerciful. And yet the imported
consciousness accepts it at last with an active
satisfaction and finds something warm and comfortable,
something that if removed would be greatly
missed, in its portentous pressure. It must be admitted,
however, that, granting that every one is
out of town, your choice of pastimes is not embarrassing.
If you have happened to spend a certain
amount of time in places where public manners have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158" name="Page_158" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_158">158</a></span>
more frankness London will seem to you scantly
provided with innocent diversions. This indeed
brings us back simply to that question of the absence
of a “public fund” of amusement to which
reference was just now made. You must give up
the idea of going to sit somewhere in the open air, to
eat an ice and listen to a band of music. You will
find neither the seat, the ice, nor the band; but on
the other hand, faithful at once to your interest and
your detachment, you may supply the place of these
delights by a little private meditation on the deep-lying
causes of the English indifference to them.
In such reflections nothing is idle—every grain
of testimony counts; and one need therefore not be
accused of jumping too suddenly from small things
to great if one traces a connection between the absence
of ices and music and the essentially hierarchical
plan of English society. This hierarchical plan
of English society is the great and ever-present fact
to the mind of a stranger: there is hardly a detail
of life that does not in some degree betray it. It
is really only in a country in which a good deal of
democratic feeling prevails that people of “refinement,”
as we say in America, will be willing to sit
at little round tables, on a pavement or a gravel-walk,
at the door of a café. The better sort are too
“genteel” and the inferior sort too base. One must
hasten to add too, in justice, that the better sort
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159" name="Page_159" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_159">159</a></span>
are, as a general thing, quite too well furnished with
entertainments of their own; they have those special
resources to which I alluded a moment since. They
are persons for whom the private machinery of ease
has been made to work with extraordinary smoothness.
If you can sit on a terrace overlooking gardens
and have your <i>café noir</i> handed you in old Worcester
cups by servants who are models of consideration,
you have hardly a decent pretext for going to a public
house. In France and Italy, in Germany and Spain,
the count and countess will sally forth and encamp
for the evening, under a row of coloured lamps, upon
the paving-stones, but it is ten to one that the count
and countess live on a single floor and up several
pair of stairs. They are, however, I think, not appreciably
affected by considerations which operate
potently in England. An Englishman who should
propose to sit down, in his own country, at a café-door,
would find himself remembering that he is
pretending to participations, contacts, fellowships
the absolute impracticability of which is expressed
in all the rest of his doings.
</p>

<p>
The study of these reasons, however, would lead
us very far from the potential little tables for ices
in—where shall I say?—in Oxford Street. But,
after all, there is no reason why our imagination
should hover about any such articles of furniture.
I am afraid they would not strike us as at the best
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160" name="Page_160" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_160">160</a></span>
happily situated. In such matters everything hangs
together, and I am certain that the customs of the
Boulevard des Italiens and the Piazza Colonna
would not harmonise with the scenery of the great
London thoroughfare. A gin-palace right and left
and a detachment of the London rabble in an
admiring semicircle—these strike one as some of
the more obvious features of the affair. Yet at the
season of which I write one’s social studies must at
the least be studies of low life, for wherever one may
go for a stroll or to spend the summer afternoon the
comparatively sordid side of things is uppermost.
There is no one in the parks save the rough characters
who are lying on their faces in the sheep-polluted
grass. These people are always tolerably
numerous in the Green Park, through which I frequently
pass, and are always an occasion for deep
wonder. But your wonder will go far if it begins to
bestir itself on behalf of the recumbent British
tramp. You perceive among them some rich possibilities.
Their velveteen legs and their colossal
high-lows, their purple necks and ear-tips, their
knotted sticks and little greasy hats, make them
look like stage-villains of realistic melodrama. I may
do them injustice, but consistent character in them
mostly requires that they shall have had a taste of
penal servitude—that they shall have paid the
penalty of stamping on some weaker human head
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161" name="Page_161" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_161">161</a></span>
with those huge square heels that are turned up to
the summer sky. Actually, however, they are innocent
enough, for they are sleeping as peacefully as
the most accomplished philanthropist, and it is their
look of having walked over half England, and of being
pennilessly hungry and thirsty, that constitutes
their romantic attractiveness. These six square feet
of brown grass are their present sufficiency; but how
long will they sleep, whither will they go next, and
whence did they come last? You permit yourself to
wish that they might sleep for ever and go nowhere
else at all.

<p class="caption">THE SHIP, GREENWICH</p>
</div>

<p>
The month of August is so uncountenanced in
London that, going a few days since to Greenwich,
that famous resort, I found it possible to get but
half a dinner. The celebrated hotel had put out its
stoves and locked up its pantry. But for this discovery
I should have mentioned the little expedition
to Greenwich as a charming relief to the monotony
of a London August. Greenwich and Richmond are,
classically, the two suburban dining-places. I know
not how it may be at this time with Richmond, but
the Greenwich incident brings me back (I hope not
once too often) to the element of what has lately
been called “particularism” in English pleasures.
It was in obedience to a perfectly logical argument
that the Greenwich hotel had, as I say, locked up
its pantry. All well-bred people leave London after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162" name="Page_162" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_162">162</a></span>
the first week in August, <i>ergo</i> those who remain
behind are not well-bred, and cannot therefore rise
to the conception of a “fish dinner.” Why then
should we have anything ready? I had other impressions,
fortunately, of this interesting suburb,
and I hasten to declare that during the period of
good-breeding the dinner at Greenwich is the most
amusing of all dinners. It begins with fish and it
continues with fish: what it ends with—except
songs and speeches and affectionate partings—I
hesitate to affirm. It is a kind of mermaid reversed;
for I do know, in a vague way, that the tail of the
creature is elaborately and interminably fleshy. If it
were not grossly indiscreet I should risk an allusion
to the particular banquet which was the occasion
of my becoming acquainted with the Greenwich
<i>cuisine</i>. I would try to express how pleasant it may
be to sit in a company of clever and distinguished
men before the large windows that look out upon
the broad brown Thames. The ships swim by confidently,
as if they were part of the entertainment
and put down in the bill; the light of the afternoon
fades ever so slowly. We eat all the fish of the sea,
and wash them down with liquids that bear no resemblance
to salt water. We partake of any number

adage, one could swallow one’s grandmother with
a good conscience. To touch on the identity of my

companions would indeed be indiscreet, but there
is nothing indelicate in marking a high appreciation
of the frankness and robustness of English conviviality.
The stranger—the American at least—who
finds himself in the company of a number
of Englishmen assembled for a convivial purpose
becomes conscious of an indefinable and delectable
something which, for want of a better name, he is
moved to call their superior richness of temperament.
He takes note of the liberal share of the individual
in the magnificent temperament of the people. This
seems to him one of the finest things in the world,
and his satisfaction will take a keener edge from
such an incident as the single one I may permit
myself to mention. It was one of those little incidents
which can occur only in an old society—a society
in which every one that a newly-arrived observer
meets strikes him as having in some degree or other
a sort of historic identity, being connected with some
one or something that he has heard of, that he has
wondered about. If they are not the rose they have
lived more or less near it. There is an old English
song-writer whom we all know and admire—whose
songs are sung wherever the language is spoken.
Of course, according to the law I just hinted at, one
of the gentlemen sitting opposite must needs be his
great-grandson. After dinner there are songs, and
the gentleman trolls out one of his ancestral ditties
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164" name="Page_164" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_164">164</a></span>
with the most charming voice and the most finished
art.

<p>
I have still other memories of Greenwich, where
there is a charming old park, on a summit of one of
whose grassy undulations the famous observatory is
perched. To do the thing completely you must
take passage upon one of the little grimy sixpenny
steamers that ply upon the Thames, perform the
journey by water, and then, disembarking, take a
stroll in the park to get up an appetite for dinner.
I find an irresistible charm in any sort of river-navigation,
but I scarce know how to speak of the
little voyage from Westminster Bridge to Greenwich.
It is in truth the most prosaic possible form
of being afloat, and to be recommended rather to the
enquiring than to the fastidious mind. It initiates
you into the duskiness, the blackness, the crowdedness,
the intensely commercial character of London.
Few European cities have a finer river than the
Thames, but none certainly has expended more
ingenuity in producing a sordid river-front. For
miles and miles you see nothing but the sooty backs
of warehouses, or perhaps they are the sooty faces:
in buildings so utterly expressionless it is impossible
to distinguish. They stand massed together on the
banks of the wide turbid stream, which is fortunately
of too opaque a quality to reflect the dismal image.
A damp-looking, dirty blackness is the universal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165" name="Page_165" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_165">165</a></span>
tone. The river is almost black, and is covered
with black barges; above the black housetops,
from among the far-stretching docks and basins,
rises a dusky wilderness of masts. The little puffing
steamer is dingy and gritty—it belches a sable
cloud that keeps you company as you go. In this
carboniferous shower your companions, who belong
chiefly indeed to the classes bereft of lustre, assume
an harmonious greyness; and the whole picture,
glazed over with the glutinous London mist,
becomes a masterly composition. But it is very
impressive in spite of its want of lightness and brightness,
and though it is ugly it is anything but trivial.
Like so many of the aspects of English civilisation
that are untouched by elegance or grace, it has the
merit of expressing something very serious. Viewed
in this intellectual light the polluted river, the
sprawling barges, the dead-faced warehouses, the
frowsy people, the atmospheric impurities become
richly suggestive. It sounds rather absurd, but all
this smudgy detail may remind you of nothing less
than the wealth and power of the British empire at
large; so that a kind of metaphysical magnificence
hovers over the scene, and supplies what may be
literally wanting. I don’t exactly understand the
association, but I know that when I look off to the
left at the East India Docks, or pass under the dark
hugely-piled bridges, where the railway trains and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166" name="Page_166" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_166">166</a></span>
the human processions are for ever moving, I feel
a kind of imaginative thrill. The tremendous piers
of the bridges, in especial, seem the very pillars of
the empire aforesaid.
</p>

<p>
It is doubtless owing to this habit of obtrusive
and unprofitable reverie that the sentimental tourist
thinks it very fine to see the Greenwich observatory
lifting its two modest little brick towers. The sight
of this useful edifice gave me a pleasure which may
at first seem extravagant. The reason was simply
that I used to see it as a child, in woodcuts, in school
geographies, and in the corners of large maps which
had a glazed, sallow surface, and which were suspended
in unexpected places, in dark halls and
behind doors. The maps were hung so high that
my eyes could reach only to the lower corners, and
these corners usually contained a print of a strange-looking
house perched among trees upon a grassy
bank that swept down before it with the most engaging
steepness. I used always to think of the joy it
must be to roll at one’s length down this curved
incline. Close at hand was usually something
printed about something being at such and such a
number of degrees “east of Greenwich.” Why east
of Greenwich? The vague wonder that the childish
mind felt on this point gave the place a mysterious
importance and seemed to put it into relation with
the difficult and fascinating parts of geography—the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167" name="Page_167" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_167">167</a></span>
countries of unintentional outline and the lonely-looking
pages of the atlas. Yet there it stood the
other day, the precise point from which the great
globe is measured; there was the plain little façade
with the old-fashioned cupolas; there was the bank
on which it would be so delightful not to be able to
stop running. It made me feel terribly old to find
that I was not even tempted to begin. There are
indeed a great many steep banks in Greenwich
Park, which tumbles up and down in the most
adventurous fashion. It is a charming place, rather
shabby and footworn, as befits a strictly popular
resort, but with a character all its own. It is filled
with magnificent foreign-looking trees, of which I
know nothing but that they have a vain appearance
of being chestnuts, planted in long, convergent
avenues, with trunks of extraordinary girth and
limbs that fling a dusky shadow far over the grass;
there are plenty of benches, and there are deer as
tame as sleepy children; and from the tops of the
bosky hillocks there are views of the widening
Thames and the moving ships and the two classic
inns by the waterside and the great pompous buildings,
designed by Inigo Jones, of the old Hospital,
which have been despoiled of their ancient pensioners
and converted into a naval academy.

<p>
Taking note of all this, I arrived at a far-away
angle in the wall of the park, where a little postern
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168" name="Page_168" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_168">168</a></span>
door stood ajar. I pushed the door open and found
myself, by a thrilling transition, upon Blackheath
Common. One had often heard, in vague, irrecoverable,
anecdotic connections, of Blackheath: well,
here it was—a great green, breezy place where
lads in corduroys were playing cricket. I am, as
a rule, moved to disproportionate ecstasy by an
English common; it may be curtailed and cockneyfied,
as this one was—which had lamp-posts stuck
about on its turf and a fresh-painted banister all
around—but it generally abounds in the note of
English breeziness, and you always seem to have
seen it water-coloured or engraved. Even if the turf
be too much trodden there is to foreign eyes an
intimate insular reference in it and in the way the
high-piled, weather-bearing clouds hang over it and
drizzle down their grey light. Still further to identify
this spot, here was the British soldier emerging from
two or three of the roads, with his cap upon his ear,
his white gloves in one hand and his foppish little
cane in the other. He wore the uniform of the
artillery, and I asked him where he had come from.
I learned that he had walked over from Woolwich and
that this feat might be accomplished in half an hour.
Inspired again by vague associations I proceeded
to accomplish its equivalent. I bent my steps to
Woolwich, a place which I knew, in a general way,
to be a nursery of British valour. At the end of my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169" name="Page_169" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_169">169</a></span>
half hour I emerged upon another common, where
the water-colour bravery had even a higher pitch.
The scene was like a chapter of some forgotten
record. The open grassy expanse was immense, and,
the evening being beautiful, it was dotted with
strolling soldiers and townsfolk. There were half
a dozen cricket-matches, both civil and military. At
one end of this peaceful <i>campus martius</i>, which
stretches over a hilltop, rises an interminable façade—one
of the fronts of the Royal Artillery barracks.
It has a very honourable air, and more windows and
doors, I imagine, than any building in Britain.
There is a great clean parade before it, and there are
many sentinels pacing in front of neatly-kept places
of ingress to officers’ quarters. Everything it looks
out upon is in the smartest military trim—the
distinguished college (where the poor young man
whom it would perhaps be premature to call the last
of the Bonapartes lately studied the art of war) on
one side; a sort of model camp, a collection of the
tidiest plank huts, on the other; a hospital, on a
well-ventilated site, at the remoter end. And then
in the town below there are a great many more
military matters: barracks on an immense scale;
a dockyard that presents an interminable dead wall
to the street; an arsenal which the gatekeeper (who
refused to admit me) declared to be “five miles” in
circumference; and, lastly, grogshops enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170" name="Page_170" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_170">170</a></span>
inflame the most craven spirit. These latter institutions
I glanced at on my way to the railway-station
at the bottom of the hill; but before departing I had
spent half an hour in strolling about the common
in vague consciousness of certain emotions that are
called into play (I speak but for myself) by almost
any glimpse of the imperial machinery of this great
country. The glimpse may be of the slightest; it
stirs a peculiar sentiment. I know not what to call
this sentiment unless it be simply an admiration for
the greatness of England. The greatness of England;
that is a very off-hand phrase, and of course
I don’t pretend to use it analytically. I use it romantically,
as it sounds in the ears of any American
who remounts the stream of time to the head waters
of his own loyalties. I think of the great part that
England has played in human affairs, the great
space she has occupied, her tremendous might, her
far-stretching rule. That these clumsily-general
ideas should be suggested by the sight of some
infinitesimal fraction of the English administrative
system may seem to indicate a cast of fancy too
hysterical; but if so I must plead guilty to the
weakness. Why should a sentry-box more or less
set one thinking of the glory of this little island,
which has found in her mere genius the means of
such a sway? This is more than I can tell; and all
I shall attempt to say is that in the difficult days that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171" name="Page_171" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_171">171</a></span>
are now elapsing a sympathising stranger finds his
meditations singularly quickened. It is the imperial
element in English history that he has chiefly cared
for, and he finds himself wondering whether the
imperial epoch is completely closed. It is a moment
when all the nations of Europe seem to be doing
something, and he waits to see what England, who
has done so much, will do. He has been meeting of
late a good many of his country-people—Americans
who live on the Continent and pretend to speak with
assurance of continental ways of feeling. These people
have been passing through London, and many
of them are in that irritated condition of mind which
appears to be the portion of the American sojourner
in the British metropolis when he is not given up to
the delights of the historic sentiment. They have
declared with assurance that the continental nations
have ceased to care a straw for what England thinks,
that her traditional prestige is completely extinct and
that the affairs of Europe will be settled quite independently
of her action and still more of her inaction.
England will do nothing, will risk nothing; there
is no cause bad enough for her not to find a selfish
interest in it—there is no cause good enough for her
to fight about it. Poor old England is defunct; it is
about time she should seek the most decent burial
possible. To all this the sympathetic stranger replies
that in the first place he doesn’t believe a word of it,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172" name="Page_172" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_172">172</a></span>
and in the second doesn’t care a fig for it—care,
that is, what the continental nations think. If the
greatness of England were really waning it would
be to him as a personal grief; and as he strolls about
the breezy common of Woolwich, with all those mementoes
of British dominion around him, he vibrates
quite too richly to be distracted by such vapours.
</p>

<p>
He wishes nevertheless, as I said before, that
England would <i>do</i> something—something striking
and powerful, which should be at once characteristic
and unexpected. He asks himself what she can do,
and he remembers that this greatness of England
which he so much admires was formerly much exemplified
in her “taking” something. Can’t she
“take” something now? There is the “Spectator,”
who wants her to occupy Egypt: can’t she occupy
Egypt? The “Spectator” considers this her moral
duty—enquires even whether she has a right <i>not</i>
to bestow the blessings of her beneficent rule upon
the down-trodden Fellaheen. I found myself in
company with an acute young Frenchman a day or
two after this eloquent plea for a partial annexation
of the Nile had appeared in the supersubtle sheet.
Some allusion was made to it, and my companion
of course pronounced it the most finished example
conceivable of insular hypocrisy. I don’t know how
powerful a defence I made of it, but while I read it
I had found the hypocrisy contagious. I recalled it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173" name="Page_173" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_173">173</a></span>
while I pursued my contemplations, but I recalled at
the same time that sadly prosaic speech of Mr. Gladstone’s
to which it had been a reply. Mr. Gladstone
had said that England had much more urgent duties
than the occupation of Egypt: she had to attend to
the great questions of—— What were the great questions?
Those of local taxation and the liquor-laws!
Local taxation and the liquor-laws! The phrase, to
my ears, just then, sounded almost squalid. These
were not the things I had been thinking of; it was
not as she should bend anxiously over these doubtless
interesting subjects that the sympathising
stranger would seem to see England in his favourite
posture—that, as Macaulay says, of hurling
defiance at her foes. Mr. Gladstone may perhaps
have been right, but Mr. Gladstone was far from
being a sympathising stranger.

<h2>
TWO EXCURSIONS
</h2>

<h3 class="lowpad">
I
</h3>

<p>
They differed greatly from each other, but
there was something to be said for each.
There seemed in respect to the first a high consensus
as to its being a pity that any stranger should
ever miss the Derby Day. Every one assured me that
this was the great festival of the English people and
that one didn’t really know them unless one had
seen them at it. So much, since it had to do with
horse-flesh, I could readily believe. Had not the
newspapers been filled for weeks with recurrent dissertations
upon the animals concerned in the ceremony?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176" name="Page_176" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_176">176</a></span>
and was not the event, to the nation at large,
only imperceptibly less momentous than the other
great question of the day—the fate of empires and
the reapportionment of the East? The space allotted
to sporting intelligence in a compact, eclectic, “intellectual”
journal like the “Pall Mall Gazette,” had
seemed for some time past a measure of the hold
of such questions upon the native mind. These
things, however, are very natural in a country in
which in “society” you are liable to make the
acquaintance of some such syllogism as the following.
You are seated at dinner next a foreign lady
who has on her other hand a communicative gentleman
through whom she is under instruction in the
art of the right point-of-view for English life. I profit
by their conversation and I learn that this point-of-view
is apparently the saddle. “You see, English
life,” says the gentleman, “is really English country-life.
It’s the country that is the basis of English
society. And you see, country-life is—well, it’s the
<i>hunting</i>. It’s the hunting that is at the bottom of it
all.” In other words “the hunting” is the basis of
English society. Duly impressed with this explanation,
the American observer is prepared for the huge
proportions of the annual pilgrimage to Epsom.
This pilgrimage, however, I was assured, though
still well worth taking part in, is by no means so
characteristic as in former days. It is now performed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177" name="Page_177" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_177">177</a></span>
in a large measure by rail, and the spectacle
on the road has lost many of its earlier and most of
its finer features. The road has been given up more
and more to the populace and the strangers and has
ceased to be graced by the presence of ladies.
Nevertheless, as a man and a stranger, I was
strongly recommended to take it, for the return
from the Derby is still, with all its abatements, a
classic show.
</p>

<p>
I mounted upon a four-horse coach, a charming
coach with a yellow body and handsome, clean-flanked
leaders; placing myself beside the coachman,
as I had been told this was the point of vantage.
The coach was one of the vehicles of the new
fashion—the fashion of public conveyances driven,
for the entertainment of themselves and of the public,
by gentlemen of leisure. On the Derby Day all
the coaches that start from the classic headquarters—the
“White Horse” in Piccadilly—and stretch
away from London toward a dozen different and
well-selected goals, had been dedicated to the Epsom
road. The body of the vehicle is empty, as no one
thinks of occupying any but one of the thirteen
places on the top. On the Derby Day, however, a
properly laden coach carries a company of hampers
and champagne-baskets in its inside places. I must
add that on this occasion my companion was by
exception a professional whip, who proved a friendly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178" name="Page_178" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_178">178</a></span>
and amusing cicerone. Other companions there were,
perched in the twelve places behind me, whose social
quality I made less of a point of testing—though in
the course of the expedition their various characteristics,
under the influence of champagne, expanded
so freely as greatly to facilitate the process. We were
a society of exotics—Spaniards, Frenchmen, Germans.
There were only two Britons, and these,
according to my theory, were Australians—an
antipodal bride and groom on a centripetal wedding-tour.
</p>

<p>
The drive to Epsom, when you get well out of
London, is sufficiently pretty; but the part of it
which most took my fancy was a district preëminently
suburban, the classic community of Clapham.
The vision of Clapham had been a part of the furniture
of one’s milder historic consciousness—the
vision of its respectable common, its evangelical
society, its rich drab humanity, its goodly brick
mansions of the Georgian era. I now seemed really
to focus these elements for the first time, and I
thought them very charming. This epithet indeed
scarcely applies to the evangelical society, which
naturally, on the morning of the Derby Day and
during the desecrating progress of the Epsom revellers,
was not much in the foreground. But all around
the verdant if cockneyfied common are ranged commodious
houses of a sober red complexion, from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179" name="Page_179" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_179">179</a></span>
under whose neo-classic pediments you expect to see
a mild-faced lady emerge—a lady in a cottage-bonnet
and mittens, distributing tracts from a green
silk satchel. It would take, however, the very ardour
of the missionary among cannibals to stem the current
of heterogeneous vehicles which at about this
point takes up its metropolitan affluents and bears
them in its rumbling, rattling tide. The concourse of
wheeled conveyances of every possible order here
becomes dense, and the spectacle from the top of the
coach proportionately absorbing. You begin to perceive
that the brilliancy of the road has in truth
departed and that a sustained high tone of appearance
is not the note of the conditions. But when once
you have grasped this fact your entertainment is
continuous. You perceive that you are “in” for the
vulgar on an unsurpassable scale, something blatantly,
unimaginably, heroically shocking to timid
“taste;” all that is necessary is to accept this situation
and look out for illustrations. Beside you, before
you, behind you, is the mighty London populace
taking its <i>ébats</i>. You get for the first time a notion
of the London population at large. It has piled
itself into carts, into omnibuses, into every possible
and impossible species of “trap.” A large proportion
of it is of course on foot, trudging along the
perilous margin of the middle way in such comfort
as may be gathered from fifteen miles’ dodging of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180" name="Page_180" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_180">180</a></span>
broken shins. The smaller the vehicle, the more rat-like
the animal that drags it, the more numerous
and ponderous its human freight; and as every one
is nursing in his lap a parcel of provender as big as
himself, wrapped in ragged newspaper, it is not surprising
that roadside halts are frequent and that
the taverns all the way to Epsom (it is wonderful
how many there are) are encompassed by dense
groups of dusty pilgrims, indulging liberally in
refreshment for man and beast. And when I say
man I must by no means be understood to exclude
woman. The female contingent on the Derby Day
is not the least remarkable part of the London outpouring.
Every one is prepared for “larks,” but
the women are even more brilliantly and resolutely
prepared than the men; there is no better chance to
follow the range of type—not that it is to be called
large—of the British female of the lower orders.
The lady in question is usually not ornamental. She
is useful, robust, prolific, excellently fitted to play
the somewhat arduous part allotted to her in the
great scheme of English civilisation, but she has not
those graces which enable her to lend herself easily
to the decoration of life. On smaller holidays, or
on simple working-days, in London crowds, I have
often thought she had points to contribute to the
primary fine drawing, as to head and shoulders, of
the Briton of the two sexes as the race at large
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181" name="Page_181" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_181">181</a></span>
sketches them. But at Epsom she is too stout, too
hot, too red, too thirsty, too boisterous, too strangely
accoutred. And yet I wish to do her justice; so
I must add that if there is something to which an
American cannot refuse a tribute of admiration in
the gross plebeian jollity of the Derby Day, it is not
evident why these dowdy Bacchantes should not get
part of the credit of it. The striking thing, the interesting
thing, both on the outward drive and on the
return, was that the holiday was so frankly, heartily,
good-humouredly taken. The people that of all peoples
is habitually the most governed by decencies,
proprieties, rigidities of conduct, was for one happy
day unbuttoning its respectable straight-jacket and
affirming its large and simple sense of the joy of life.
In such a spectacle there was inevitably much that
was unlucky and unprofitable; these things came
uppermost chiefly on the return, when demoralisation
was supreme, when the temperament of the
people had begun really to take the air. For the rest,
to be dressed with a kind of brutal gaudiness, to be
very thirsty and violently flushed, to laugh perpetually
at everything and at nothing, thoroughly to
enjoy, in short, a momentous occasion—all this is
not, in simple persons of the more susceptible sex,
an unpardonable crime.

<p class="caption">THE START FOR THE DERBY</p>
</div>

<p>
The course at Epsom is in itself very pretty, and
disposed by nature herself in sympathetic prevision
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182" name="Page_182" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_182">182</a></span>
of the sporting passion. It is something like the
crater of a volcano without the mountain. The
outer rim is the course proper; the space within it
is a vast, shallow, grassy concavity in which vehicles
are drawn up and beasts tethered and in which the
greater part of the multitude—the mountebanks,
the betting-men, and the myriad hangers-on of the
scene—are congregated. The outer margin of the
uplifted rim in question is occupied by the grand
stand, the small stands, the paddock. The day was
exceptionally beautiful; the charming sky was
spotted over with little idle-looking, loafing, irresponsible
clouds; the Epsom Downs went swelling
away as greenly as in a coloured sporting-print, and
the wooded uplands, in the middle distance, looked
as innocent and pastoral as if they had never seen
a policeman or a rowdy. The crowd that spread
itself over this immense expanse was as rich representation
of human life off its guard as one need see.
One’s first fate after arriving, if one is perched upon
a coach, is to see the coach guided, by means best
known to the coachman himself, through the tremendous
press of vehicles and pedestrians, introduced
into a precinct roped off and guarded from
intrusion save under payment of a fee, and then
drawn up alongside of the course, as nearly as possible
opposite the grand stand and the winning
post. Here you have only to stand up in your place—on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183" name="Page_183" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_183">183</a></span>
tiptoe, it is true, and with a good deal of
stretching—to see the race fairly well. But I hasten
to add that seeing the race is indifferent entertainment.
In the first place you <i>don’t</i> see it, and in the
second—to be Irish on the occasion of a frolic—you
perceive it to be not much worth the seeing.
It may be fine in quality, but in quantity it is inappreciable.
The horses and their jockeys first go
dandling and cantering along the course to the
starting-point, looking as insubstantial as sifted
sunbeams. Then there is a long wait, during which,
of the sixty thousand people present (my figures are
imaginary), thirty thousand declare positively that
they have started, and thirty thousand as positively
deny it. Then the whole sixty thousand are suddenly
resolved into unanimity by the sight of a
dozen small jockey-heads whizzing along a very
distant sky-line. In a shorter space of time than it
takes me to write it, the whole thing is before you,
and for the instant it is anything but beautiful. A
dozen furiously revolving arms—pink, green,
orange, scarlet, white—whacking the flanks of as
many straining steeds; a glimpse of this, and the
spectacle is over. The spectacle, however, is of
course an infinitesimally small part of the purpose
of Epsom and the interest of the Derby. The finer
vibration resides presumably in having money on
the affair.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184" name="Page_184" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_184">184</a></span>
</p>

<p>
When the Derby stakes had been carried off by
a horse of which I confess I am barbarous enough
to have forgotten the name, I turned my back to
the running, for all the world as if I too were largely
“interested,” and sought entertainment in looking
at the crowd. The crowd was very animated; that
is the most succinct description I can give of it.
The horses of course had been removed from the
vehicles, so that the pedestrians were free to surge
against the wheels and even to a certain extent to
scale and overrun the carriages. This tendency
became most pronounced when, as the mid-period
of the day was reached, the process of lunching
began to unfold itself and every coach-top to become
the scene of a picnic. From this moment, at the
Derby, demoralisation begins. I was in a position
to observe it, all around me, in the most characteristic
forms. The whole affair, as regards the conventional
rigidities I spoke of a while since, becomes
a real <i>dégringolade</i>. The shabbier pedestrians bustle
about the vehicles, staring up at the lucky mortals
who are perched in a kind of tormentingly near
empyrean—a region in which dishes of lobster-salad
are passed about and champagne-corks cleave
the air like celestial meteors. There are nigger-minstrels
and beggars and mountebanks and spangled
persons on stilts and gipsy matrons, as genuine as
possible, with glowing Oriental eyes and dropping
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185" name="Page_185" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_185">185</a></span>
their <i>h</i>’s; these last offer you for sixpence the promise
of everything genteel in life except the aspirate.
On a coach drawn up beside the one on which
I had a place, a party of opulent young men were
passing from stage to stage of the higher beatitude
with a zeal which excited my admiration. They
were accompanied by two or three young ladies of
the kind that usually shares the choicest pleasures
of youthful British opulence—young ladies in
whom nothing has been neglected that can make
a complexion superlative. The whole party had
been drinking deep, and one of the young men, a
pretty lad of twenty, had in an indiscreet moment
staggered down as best he could to the ground.
Here his cups proved too many for him, and he collapsed
and rolled over. In plain English he was
beastly drunk. It was the scene that followed that
arrested my observation. His companions on the
top of the coach called down to the people herding
under the wheels to pick him up and put him away
inside. These people were the grimiest of the rabble,
and a couple of men who looked like coal-heavers
out of work undertook to handle this hapless youth.
But their task was difficult; it was impossible to
imagine a young man more drunk. He was a mere
bag of liquor—at once too ponderous and too
flaccid to be lifted. He lay in a helpless heap under
the feet of the crowd—the best-intoxicated young
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186" name="Page_186" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_186">186</a></span>
man in England. His extemporised chamberlains
took him first in one way and then in another; but
he was like water in a sieve. The crowd hustled over
him; every one wanted to see; he was pulled and
shoved and fumbled. The spectacle had a grotesque
side, and this it was that seemed to strike the
fancy of the young man’s comrades. They had not
done lunching, so they were unable to bestow upon
the accident the whole of that consideration which
its high comicality deserved. But they did what
they could. They looked down very often, glass in
hand, during the half-hour that it went on, and they
stinted neither their generous, joyous laughter nor
their appreciative comments. Women are said to
have no sense of humour; but the young ladies with
the complexions did liberal justice to the pleasantry
of the scene. Toward the last indeed their attention
rather flagged; for even the best joke suffers by
reiteration, and when you have seen a stupefied
young man, infinitely bedusted, slip out of the embrace
of a couple of clumsy roughs for the twentieth
time, you may very properly suppose that you have
arrived at the furthest limits of the ludicrous.

<p class="caption">THE FINISH OF THE DERBY</p>
</div>

<p>
After the great race had been run I quitted my
perch and spent the rest of the afternoon in wandering
about the grassy concave I have mentioned. It
was amusing and picturesque; it was just a huge
Bohemian encampment. Here also a great number
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187" name="Page_187" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_187">187</a></span>
of carriages were stationed, freighted in like manner
with free-handed youths and young ladies with
gilded hair. These young ladies were almost the
only representatives of their sex with pretensions
to elegance; they were often pretty and always exhilarated.
Gentlemen in pairs, mounted on stools,
habited in fantastic sporting garments and offering
bets to whomsoever listed, were a conspicuous
feature of the scene. It was equally striking that
they were not preaching in the desert and that they
found plenty of patrons among the baser sort. I
returned to my place in time to assist at the rather
complicated operation of starting for the drive back
to London. Putting in horses and getting vehicles
into line seemed in the midst of the general crush
and entanglement a process not to be facilitated
even by the most liberal swearing on the part of
those engaged in it. But little by little we came to
the end of it; and as by this time a kind of mellow
cheerfulness pervaded the upper atmosphere—the
region of the perpendicular whip—even those
interruptions most trying to patience were somehow
made to minister to jollity. It was for people
below not to get trampled to death or crunched
between opposing wheel-hubs, but it was all for
them to manage it. Above, the carnival of “chaff”
had set in, and it deepened as the lock of vehicles
grew denser. As they were all locked together (with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188" name="Page_188" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_188">188</a></span>
a comfortable padding of pedestrians at points of
acutest contact), they contrived somehow to move
together; so that we gradually got away and into
the road. The four or five hours consumed on the
road were simply an exchange of repartee, the profusely
good-humoured savour of which, on the whole,
was certainly striking. The chaff was not brilliant
nor subtle nor especially graceful; and here and
there it was quite too tipsy to be even articulate. But
as an expression of that unbuttoning of the popular
straight-jacket of which I spoke awhile since, it
had its wholesome and even innocent side. It took
indeed frequently an importunate physical form;
it sought emphasis in the use of pea-shooters and
water-squirts. At its best, too, it was extremely low
and rowdyish. But a stranger even of the most refined
tastes might be glad to have a glimpse of this
popular revel, for it would make him feel that he was
learning something more about the English people.
It would give a meaning to the old description of
England as merry. It would remind him that the
natives of that country are subject to some of the
lighter of the human impulses, and that the decent,
dusky vistas of the London residential streets—those
discreet creations of which Thackeray’s
Baker Street is the type—are not a complete symbol
of the complicated race that erected them.

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
It seemed to me such a piece of good fortune to
have been asked down to Oxford at Commemoration
by a gentleman implicated in the remarkable ceremony
which goes on under that name, who kindly
offered me the hospitality of his college, that I
scarcely stayed even to thank him—I simply went
and awaited him. I had had a glimpse of Oxford in
former years, but I had never slept in a low-browed
room looking out on a grassy quadrangle and opposite
a mediæval clock-tower. This satisfaction was
vouchsafed me on the night of my arrival; I was
made free of the rooms of an absent undergraduate.
I sat in his deep armchairs; I burned his candles and
read his books, and I hereby thank him as effusively
as possible. Before going to bed I took a turn
through the streets and renewed in the silent darkness
that impression of the charm imparted to them
by the quiet college-fronts which I had gathered in
former years. The college-fronts were now quieter
than ever, the streets were empty, and the old
scholastic city was sleeping in the warm starlight.
The undergraduates had retired in large numbers,
encouraged in this impulse by the collegiate authorities,
who deprecate their presence at Commemoration.
However many young gownsmen may be sent
away, there yet always remain a collection sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190" name="Page_190" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_190">190</a></span>
to represent the sound of many voices. There can be
no better indication of the resources of Oxford in
a spectacular way than this fact that the first step
toward preparing an impressive ceremony is to get
rid of as many as possible of the actors.
</p>

<p>
In the morning I breakfasted with a young
American who, in common with a number of his
countrymen, had come hither to seek stimulus for
a finer strain of study. I know not whether he
would have reckoned as such stimulus the conversation
of a couple of those ingenuous youths, sons of
the soil, whose society I always find charming; but
it added, from my own point of view, in respect to the
place, to the element of intensity of character. After
the entertainment was over, I repaired, in company
with a crowd of ladies and elderly people, interspersed
with gownsmen, to the hoary rotunda of the
Sheldonian theatre, which every visitor to Oxford
will remember from its curious cincture of clumsily
carven heads of warriors and sages perched upon
stone posts. The interior of this edifice is the scene
of the classic hooting, stamping, and cat-calling by
which the undergraduates confer the last consecration
upon the distinguished gentlemen who come
up for the honorary degree of D.C.L. It is with
the design of attenuating as much as possible this
volume of sound that the heads of colleges, on the
close of the term, a few days before Commemoration,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191" name="Page_191" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_191">191</a></span>
speed their too demonstrative disciples upon
the homeward way. As I have already hinted, however,
the contingent of irreverence was on this occasion
quite large enough to preserve the type of the
racket. This made the scene a very singular one.
An American of course, with his fondness for antiquity,
his relish for picturesqueness, his “emotional”
attitude at historic shrines, takes Oxford much more
seriously than its sometimes unwilling familiars can
be expected to do. These people are not always
upon the high horse; they are not always in a state
of fine vibration. Nevertheless there is a certain
maximum of disaccord with their beautiful circumstances
which the ecstatic outsider vaguely expects
them not to transcend. No effort of the intellect
beforehand would enable him to imagine one of
those silver-grey temples of learning converted into
a semblance of the Bowery Theatre when the Bowery
Theatre is being trifled with.
</p>

<p>
The Sheldonian edifice, like everything at Oxford,
is more or less monumental. There is a double
tier of galleries, with sculptured pulpits protruding
from them; there are full-length portraits of kings
and worthies; there is a general air of antiquity and
dignity, which, on the occasion of which I speak,
was enhanced by the presence of certain ancient
scholars seated in crimson robes in high-backed
chairs. Formerly, I believe, the undergraduates
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192" name="Page_192" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_192">192</a></span>
were placed apart—packed together in a corner of
one of the galleries. But now they are scattered
among the general spectators, a large number of
whom are ladies. They muster in especial force,
however, on the floor of the theatre, which has been
cleared of its benches. Here the dense mass is at
last severed in twain by the entrance of the prospective
D.C.L.’s walking in single file, clad in crimson
gowns, preceded by mace-bearers and accompanied
by the Regius professor of Civil Law, who presents
them individually to the Vice-Chancellor of the
University, in a Latin speech which is of course a
glowing eulogy. The five gentlemen to whom this
distinction had been offered in 1877 were not among
those whom fame has trumpeted most loudly; but
there was something “as pretty as a picture” in their
standing in their honourable robes, with heads modestly
bent, while the orator, as effectively draped,
recited their titles sonorously to the venerable dignitary
in the high-backed chair. Each of them, when
the little speech is ended, ascends the steps leading
to the chair; the Vice-Chancellor bends forward
and shakes his hand, and the new D.C.L. goes and
sits in the blushing row of his fellow doctors. The
impressiveness of all this is much diminished by the
boisterous conduct of the “students,” who super-abound
in extravagant applause, in impertinent
interrogation, and in lively disparagement of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193" name="Page_193" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_193">193</a></span>
orator’s Latinity. Of the scene that precedes the
episode I have just described I have given no account;
vivid portrayal of it is not easy. Like the
return from the Derby it is a carnival of “chaff;”
and it is a singular fact that the scholastic festival
should have forcibly reminded me of the great popular
“lark.” In each case it is the same race enjoying
a certain definitely chartered license; in the young
votaries of a liberal education and the London rabble
on the Epsom road it is the same perfect good
humour, the same muscular jocosity.
</p>

<p>
After the presentation of the doctors came a series
of those collegiate exercises which have a generic
resemblance all the world over: a reading of Latin
verses and English essays, a spouting of prize poems
and Greek paraphrases. The prize poem alone was
somewhat attentively listened to; the other things
were received with an infinite variety of critical
ejaculation. But after all, I reflected, as the ceremony
drew to a close, the romping element is more
characteristic than it seems; it is at bottom only
another expression of the venerable and historic
side of Oxford. It is tolerated because it is traditional;
it is possible because it is classical. Looked
at in this light it became romantically continuous
with the human past that everything else referred to.
</p>

<p>
I was not obliged to find ingenious pretexts for
thinking well of another ceremony of which I was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194" name="Page_194" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_194">194</a></span>
witness after we adjourned from the Sheldonian
theatre. This was a lunch-party at the particular
college in which I should find it the highest privilege
to reside and which I may not further specify. Perhaps
indeed I may go so far as to say that the reason
for my dreaming of this privilege is that it is deemed
by persons of a reforming turn the best-appointed
abuse in a nest of abuses. A commission for the
expurgation of the universities has lately been
appointed by Parliament to look into it—a commission
armed with a gigantic broom, which is to
sweep away all the fine old ivied and cobwebbed
improprieties. Pending these righteous changes, one
would like while one is about it—about, that is, this
business of admiring Oxford—to attach one’s self
to the abuse, to bury one’s nostrils in the rose before
it is plucked. At the college in question there are no
undergraduates. I found it agreeable to reflect that
those grey-green cloisters had sent no delegates to
the slangy congregation I had just quitted. This
delightful spot exists for the satisfaction of a small
society of Fellows who, having no dreary instruction
to administer, no noisy hobbledehoys to govern, no
obligations but toward their own culture, no care
save for learning as learning and truth as truth, are
presumably the happiest and most charming people
in the world. The party invited to lunch assembled
first in the library of the college, a cool, grey hall,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195" name="Page_195" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_195">195</a></span>
of very great length and height, with vast wall-spaces
of rich-looking book-titles and statues of noble
scholars set in the midst. Had the charming Fellows
ever anything more disagreeable to do than to
finger these precious volumes and then to stroll about
together in the grassy courts, in learned comradeship,
discussing their precious contents? Nothing, apparently,
unless it were to give a lunch at Commemoration
in the dining-hall of the college. When lunch
was ready there was a very pretty procession to go
to it. Learned gentlemen in crimson gowns, ladies
in bright finery, paired slowly off and marched in a
stately diagonal across the fine, smooth lawn of the
quadrangle, in a corner of which they passed through
a hospitable door. But here we cross the threshold
of privacy; I remained on the further side of it
during the rest of the day. But I brought back with
me certain memories, of which, if I were not at the
end of my space, I should attempt a discreet adumbration:
memories of a fête champêtre in the beautiful
gardens of one of the other colleges—charming
lawns and spreading trees, music of Grenadier
Guards, ices in striped marquees, mild flirtation of
youthful gownsmen and bemuslined maidens; memories,
too, of quiet dinner in common-room, a decorous,
excellent repast; old portraits on the walls
and great windows open upon the ancient court,
where the afternoon light was fading in the stillness;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196" name="Page_196" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_196">196</a></span>
superior talk upon current topics, and over all the
peculiar air of Oxford—the air of liberty to care
for the things of the mind assured and secured by
machinery which is in itself a satisfaction to sense.

<h2>
IN WARWICKSHIRE
</h2>

<p>
There is no better way to plunge <i>in medias
res</i>, for the stranger who wishes to know
something of England, than to spend a fortnight in
Warwickshire. It is the core and centre of the English
world; midmost England, unmitigated England.
The place has taught me a great many English
secrets; I have been interviewing the genius of
pastoral Britain. From a charming lawn—a lawn
delicious to one’s sentient boot-sole—I looked without
obstruction at a sombre, soft, romantic mass
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198" name="Page_198" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_198">198</a></span>
whose outline was blurred by mantling ivy. It made
a perfect picture, and in the foreground the great
trees overarched their boughs, from right and left,
so as to give it a majestic frame. This interesting
object was the castle of Kenilworth. It was within
distance of an easy walk, but one hardly thought
of walking to it, any more than one would have
thought of walking to a purple-shadowed tower in
the background of a Berghem or a Claude. Here
were purple shadows and slowly-shifting lights,
with a soft-hued, bosky country for the middle
distance.
</p>

<p>
Of course, however, I did walk over to the castle;
and of course the walk led me through leafy lanes
and beside the hedgerows that make a tangled screen
for large lawn-like meadows. Of course too, I am
bound to add, there was a row of ancient pedlars outside
the castle-wall, hawking twopenny pamphlets
and photographs. Of course, equally, at the foot
of the grassy mound on which the ruin stands were
half a dozen public houses and, always of course,
half a dozen beery vagrants sprawling on the grass
in the moist sunshine. There was the usual respectable
young woman to open the castle-gate and to
receive the usual sixpenny fee. There were the
usual squares of printed cardboard, suspended upon
venerable surfaces, with further enumeration of twopence,
threepence, fourpence. I do not allude to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199" name="Page_199" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_199">199</a></span>
these things querulously, for Kenilworth is a very
tame lion—a lion that, in former years, I had
stroked more than once. I remember perfectly my
first visit to this romantic spot; how I chanced upon
a picnic; how I stumbled over beer-bottles; how
the very echoes of the beautiful ruin seemed to have
dropped all their <i>h</i>’s. That was a sultry afternoon;
I allowed my spirits to sink and I came away hanging
my head. This was a beautiful fresh morning,
and in the interval I had grown philosophic. I had
learned that, with regard to most romantic sites in
England, there is a constant cockneyfication with
which you must make your account. There are
always people on the field before you, and there is
generally something being drunk on the premises.
</p>

<p>
I hoped, on the occasion of which I am now speaking,
that the attack would not be acute, and indeed
for the first five minutes I flattered myself that this
was the case. In the beautiful grassy court of the
castle, on my entrance, there were not more than
eight or ten fellow intruders. There were a couple
of old ladies on a bench, eating something out of
a newspaper; there was a dissenting minister, also
on a bench, reading the guide-book aloud to his
wife and sister-in-law; there were three or four children
pushing each other up and down the turfy hillocks.
This was sweet seclusion indeed; and I got a
capital start with the various noble square-windowed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200" name="Page_200" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_200">200</a></span>
fragments of the stately pile. They are extremely
majestic, with their even, pale-red colour, their deep-green
drapery, their princely vastness of scale. But
presently the tranquil ruin began to swarm like a
startled hive. There were plenty of people, if they
chose to show themselves. They emerged from
crumbling doorways and gaping chambers with the
best conscience in the world; but I know not, after
all, why I should bear them a grudge, for they gave
me a pretext for wandering about in search of a quiet
point of view. I cannot say that I found my point of
view, but in looking for it I saw the castle, which is
certainly an admirable ruin. And when the respectable
young woman had let me out of the gate again,
and I had shaken my head at the civil-spoken pedlars
who form a little avenue for the arriving and
departing visitor, I found it in my good nature to
linger a moment on the trodden, grassy slope, and
to think that in spite of the hawkers, the paupers,
and the beer-shops, there was still a good deal of old
England in the scene. I say in spite of these things,
but it may have been, in some degree, because of
them. Who shall resolve into its component parts
any impression of this richly complex English world,
where the present is always seen, as it were, in profile,
and the past presents a full face? At all events
the solid red castle rose behind me, towering above
its small old ladies and its investigating parsons;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201" name="Page_201" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_201">201</a></span>
before me, across the patch of common, was a row
of ancient cottages, black-timbered, red-gabled,
pictorial, which evidently had a memory of the
castle in its better days. A quaintish village straggled
away on the right, and on the left the dark, fat
meadows were lighted up with misty sun-spots and
browsing sheep. I looked about for the village
stocks; I was ready to take the modern vagrants for
Shakespearean clowns; and I was on the point of
going into one of the ale-houses to ask Mrs. Quickly
for a cup of sack.
</p>

<p>
I began these remarks, however, with no intention
of talking about the celebrated curiosities in
which this region abounds, but with a design rather
of noting a few impressions of some of the shyer and
more elusive ornaments of the show. Stratford of
course is a very sacred place, but I prefer to say a
word, for instance, about a charming old rectory
a good many miles distant, and to mention the
pleasant picture it made, of a summer afternoon,
during a domestic festival. These are the happiest of
a stranger’s memories of English life, and he feels
that he need make no apology for lifting the corner of
the curtain. I drove through the leafy lanes I spoke
of just now, and peeped over the hedges into fields
where the yellow harvest stood waiting. In some
places they were already shorn, and, while the light
began to redden in the west and to make a horizontal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202" name="Page_202" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_202">202</a></span>
glow behind the dense wayside foliage, the
gleaners here and there came brushing through gaps
in the hedges with enormous sheaves upon their
shoulders. The rectory was an ancient, gabled
building, of pale red brick with facings of white
stone and creepers that wrapped it up. It dates, I
imagine, from the early Hanoverian time; and as it
stood there upon its cushiony lawn and among its
ordered gardens, cheek to cheek with its little Norman
church, it seemed to me the model of a quiet,
spacious, easy English home. The cushiony lawn,
as I have called it, stretched away to the edge of
a brook, and afforded to a number of very amiable
people an opportunity of playing lawn-tennis. There
were half a dozen games going forward at once, and
at each of them a great many “nice girls,” as they
say in England, were distinguishing themselves.
These young ladies kept the ball going with an
agility worthy of the sisters and sweethearts of a
race of cricketers, and gave me a chance to admire
their flexibility of figure and their freedom of action.
When they came back to the house, after the games,
flushed a little and a little dishevelled, they might
have passed for the attendant nymphs of Diana
flocking in from the chase. There had, indeed, been
a chance for them to wear the quiver, a target for
archery being erected on the lawn. I remembered
George Eliot’s Gwendolen and waited to see her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203" name="Page_203" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_203">203</a></span>
step out of the muslin group; but she was not forthcoming,
and it was plain that if lawn-tennis had been
invented in Gwendolen’s day this young lady would
have captivated Mr. Grandcourt by her exploits
with the racket. She certainly would have been a
mistress of the game; and, if the suggestion be not
too gross, the alertness she would have learned from
it might have proved an inducement to her boxing
the ears of the insupportable Deronda.
</p>

<p>
After a while it grew too dark for lawn-tennis;
but while the twilight was still mildly brilliant I
wandered away, out of the grounds of the charming
parsonage, and turned into the little churchyard
beside it. The small weather-worn, rust-coloured
church had an appearance of high antiquity; there
were some curious Norman windows in the apse.
Unfortunately I could not get inside; I could only
glance into the open door across the interval of an
old-timbered, heavy-hooded, padlocked porch. But
the sweetest evening stillness hung over the place,
and the sunset was red behind a dark row of rook-haunted
elms. The stillness seemed the greater
because three or four rustic children were playing,
with little soft cries, among the crooked, deep-buried
grave-stones. One poor little girl, who seemed deformed,
had climbed some steps that served as a
pedestal for a tall, mediæval-looking cross. She sat
perched there and stared at me through the gloaming.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204" name="Page_204" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_204">204</a></span>
This was the heart of England, unmistakeably;
it might have been the very pivot of the wheel on
which her fortune revolves. One need not be a rabid
Anglican to be extremely sensible of the charm of
an English country church—and indeed of some
of the features of an English rural Sunday. In London
there is a certain flatness in the observance of
this festival; but in the country some of the ceremonies
that accompany it have an indefinable harmony
with an ancient, pastoral landscape. I made
this reflection on an occasion that is still very fresh in
my memory. I said to myself that the walk to church
from a beautiful country-house, of a lovely summer
afternoon, may be the prettiest possible adventure.
The house stands perched upon a pedestal of rock
and looks down from its windows and terraces upon
a shadier spot in the wooded meadows, of which the
blunted tip of a spire explains the character. A little
company of people, whose costume denotes the
highest pitch of civilisation, winds down through the
blooming gardens, passes out of a couple of small
gates, and reaches the footpath in the fields. This is
especially what takes the fancy of the sympathetic
stranger; the level, deep-green meadows, studded
here and there with a sturdy oak; the denser grassiness
of the footpath, the lily-sheeted pool beside
which it passes, the rustic stiles, where he stops and
looks back at the great house and its wooded background.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205" name="Page_205" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_205">205</a></span>
It is in the highest degree probable that he
has the privilege of walking with a pretty girl, and it
is morally certain that he thinks a pretty English
girl the very type of the maddening magic of youth.
He knows that she doesn’t know how lovely is this
walk of theirs; she has been taking it—or taking
another quite as good—any time these twenty years.
But her want of immediate intelligence only makes
her the more a part of his delicate entertainment.
The latter continues unbroken while they reach the
little churchyard and pass up to the ancient porch,
round which the rosy rustics are standing, decently
and deferentially, to watch the arrival of the smarter
contingent. This party takes its place in a great
square pew, as large as a small room, and with seats
all round, and while he listens to the respectable
intonings the sympathetic stranger reads over the
inscriptions on the mural tablets before him, all to
the honour of the earlier bearers of a name which
is, for himself, a symbol of hospitality.
</p>

<p>
When I came back to the parsonage the entertainment
had been transferred to the interior, and
I had occasion to admire the maidenly vigour of all
the nice girls who, after playing lawn-tennis all the
afternoon, were modestly expecting to dance all the
evening. And in regard to this it is not impertinent
to say that from almost any group of young English
creatures of this order—though preferably from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206" name="Page_206" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_206">206</a></span>
such as have passed their lives in quiet country
homes—an American receives a delightful impression
of something that he may describe as an intimate
salubrity. He notices face after face in which
this rosy absence of a morbid strain—this simple,
natural, affectionate development—amounts to
positive beauty. If the young lady have no other
beauty the air I speak of is a charm in itself; but
when it is united, as it so often is, to real perfection
of feature and colour the result is the most delightful
thing in nature. It makes the highest type of English
beauty, and to my sense there is nothing so satisfyingly
high as that. Not long since I heard a clever
foreigner indulge, in conversation with an English
lady,—a very wise and liberal woman,—in a little
lightly restrictive criticism of her countrywomen.
“It is possible,” she answered, in regard to one of
his objections; “but such as they are, they are inexpressibly
dear to their husbands.” This is doubtless
true of good wives all over the world; but I felt,
as I listened to these words of my friend, that there
is often something in an English girl-face which gives
it an extra touch of <i>justesse</i>. Such as the woman
is, she has here, more than elsewhere, the look of
being completely and profoundly, without reservations
for other uses, at the service of the man she
loves. This look, after one has been a while in
England, comes to seem so much a proper and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207" name="Page_207" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_207">207</a></span>
indispensable part of a “nice” face, that the absence
of it appears a sign of irritability or of shallowness.
Latent responsiveness to the manly appeal—that
is what it means; which one must take as a very
comfortable meaning.
</p>

<p>
As for the prettiness, I cannot forbear, in the
face of a fresh reminiscence, to give it another word.
And yet in regard to prettiness what do words avail?
This was what I asked myself the other day as
I looked at a young girl who stood in an old oaken
parlour, the rugged panels of which made a background
for her lovely head, in simple conversation
with a handsome lad. I said to myself that the faces
of the English young have often a perfect charm,
but that this same charm is too soft and shy a thing
to talk about. The face of this fair creature had a
pure oval, and her clear brown eyes a quiet warmth.
Her complexion was as bright as a sunbeam after
rain, and she smiled in a way that made any other
way of smiling than that seem a shallow grimace—a
mere creaking of the facial muscles. The young
man stood facing her, slowly scratching his thigh
and shifting from one foot to the other. He was tall
and straight, and so sun-burned that his fair hair
was lighter than his complexion. He had honest,
stupid blue eyes, and a simple smile that showed
handsome teeth. He had the look of a gentleman.
Presently I heard what they were saying. “I suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208" name="Page_208" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_208">208</a></span>
it’s pretty big,” said the beautiful young girl.
“Yes; it’s pretty big,” said the handsome young
man. “It’s nicer when they are big,” said his interlocutress.
The young man looked at her, and at
everything in general, with his slowly apprehending
blue eye, and for some time no further remark was
made. “It draws ten feet of water,” he at last went
on. “How much water is there?” said the young
girl. She spoke in a charming voice. “There are
thirty feet of water,” said the young man. “Oh,
that’s enough,” rejoined the damsel. I had had
an idea they were flirting, and perhaps indeed that
is the way it is done. It was an ancient room and
extremely delightful; everything was polished over
with the brownness of centuries. The chimney-piece
was carved a foot thick, and the windows bore, in
coloured glass, the quarterings of ancestral couples.
These had stopped two hundred years before; there
was nothing newer than that date. Outside the
windows was a deep, broad moat, which washed
the base of grey walls—grey walls spotted over
with the most delicate yellow lichens.

In such a region as this mellow conservative Warwickshire
an appreciative American finds the small
things quite as suggestive as the great. Everything
indeed is suggestive, and impressions are constantly
melting into each other and doing their work before
he has had time to ask them whence they came. He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209" name="Page_209" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_209">209</a></span>
can scarce go into a cottage muffled in plants, to see
a genial gentlewoman and a “nice girl,” without
being reminded forsooth of the “Small House at
Allington.” Why of the “Small House at Allington?”
There is a larger house to which the ladies
come up to dine; but that is surely an insufficient
reason. That the ladies are charming—even that
is not reason enough; for there have been other nice
girls in the world than Lily Dale and other mild
matrons than her mamma. Reminded, however, he
is—especially when he goes out upon the lawn. Of
course there is lawn-tennis, and it seems all ready
for Mr. Crosbie to come and take a racquet. This is
a small example of the way in which in the presence
of English life the imagination must be constantly at
play on the part of members of a race in whom it
has necessarily been trained to do extra service. In
driving and walking, in looking and listening, everything
affected one as in some degree or other characteristic
of a rich, powerful, old-fashioned society.
One had no need of being told that this is a conservative
county; the fact seemed written in the
hedgerows and in the verdant acres behind them.
Of course the owners of these things were conservative;
of course they were stubbornly unwilling to
see the harmonious edifice of their constituted, convenient
world the least bit shaken. I had a feeling,
as I went about, that I should find some very ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210" name="Page_210" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_210">210</a></span>
and curious opinions still comfortably domiciled in
the fine old houses whose clustered gables and chimneys
appeared here and there, at a distance, above
their ornamental woods. Imperturbable British
Toryism, viewed in this vague and conjectural
fashion—across the fields and behind the oaks and
beeches—is by no means a thing the irresponsible
stranger would wish away; it deepens the very colour
of the air; it may be said to be the style of the
landscape. I got a sort of constructive sense of its
presence in the picturesque old towns of Coventry
and Warwick, which appear to be filled with those
institutions—chiefly of an eleemosynary order—that
make the undoubting more undoubting still.
There are ancient charities in these places—hospitals,
almshouses, asylums, infant-schools—so quaint
and venerable that they almost make the existence
of respectful dependence a delectable and satisfying
thought. In Coventry in especial, I believe, these
pious foundations are so numerous as fairly to place
a premium upon personal woe. Invidious reflections
apart, however, there are few things that speak more
quaintly and suggestively of the old England that an
American loves than these clumsy little monuments
of ancient benevolence. Such an institution as
Leicester’s Hospital at Warwick seems indeed to
exist primarily for the sake of its spectacular effect
upon the American tourists, who, with the dozen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211" name="Page_211" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_211">211</a></span>
rheumatic old soldiers maintained in affluence there,
constitute its principal <i>clientèle</i>.
</p>

<p>
The American tourist usually comes straight to
this quarter of England—chiefly for the purpose of
paying his respects to the birthplace of Shakespeare.
Being here, he comes to Warwick to see the castle;
and being at Warwick, he comes to see the odd little
theatrical-looking refuge for superannuated warriors
which lurks in the shadow of one of the old gate-towers.
Every one will remember Hawthorne’s
account of the place, which has left no touch of
charming taste to be added to any reference to it.
The hospital struck me as a little museum kept up
for the amusement and confusion of those enquiring
Occidentals who are used to seeing charity more
dryly and practically administered. The old hospitallers—I
am not sure, after all, whether they are
necessarily soldiers, but some of them happen to be—are
at once the curiosities and the keepers. They
sit on benches outside of their door, at the receipt of
custom, all neatly brushed and darned and ready
to do you the honours. They are only twelve in
number, but their picturesque dwelling, perched
upon the old city rampart and full of dusky little
courts, cross-timbered gable-ends and deeply sunken
lattices, seems a wonderfully elaborate piece of
machinery for its humble purpose. Each of the old
gentlemen must be provided with a wife or “housekeeper;”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212" name="Page_212" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_212">212</a></span>
each of them has a dusky parlour of his
own, and they pass their latter days in their scoured
and polished little refuge as softly and honourably
as a company of retired lawgivers or pensioned
soothsayers.
</p>

<p>
At Coventry I went to see a couple of old
charities of a similar pattern—places with black-timbered
fronts, little clean-swept courts and Elizabethan
windows. One of them was a romantic
residence for a handful of old women, who sat, each
of them, in a cosy little bower, in a sort of mediæval
darkness; the other was a school for little boys
of humble origin, and this last establishment was
charming. I found the little boys playing at “top”
in a gravelled court, in front of the prettiest old building
of tender-coloured stucco and painted timber,
ornamented with two delicate little galleries and
a fantastic porch. They were dressed in small blue
tunics and odd caps, like those worn by sailors, but,
if I remember rightly, with little yellow tags affixed.
I was able to wander at my pleasure all over
the establishment; there was no sign of pastor or
master anywhere; nothing but the little yellow-headed
boys playing before the ancient house and
practising most correctly the Warwickshire accent.
I went indoors and looked at a fine old oaken staircase;
I even ascended it and walked along a gallery
and peeped into a dormitory at a row of very short
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213" name="Page_213" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_213">213</a></span>
beds; and then I came down and sat for five minutes
on a bench hardly wider than the top rail of
a fence, in a little, cold, dim refectory where there
was not a crumb to be seen, nor any lingering odour
of bygone repasts to be perceived. And yet I wondered
how it was that the sense of many generations
of boyish feeders seemed to abide there. It came,
I suppose, from the very bareness and, if I may be
allowed the expression, the clean-licked aspect of the
place, which wore the appearance of the famous
platter of Jack Sprat and his wife.
</p>

<p>
Inevitably, of course, the sentimental tourist has
a great deal to say to himself about this being
Shakespeare’s county—about these densely grassed
meadows and parks having been, to his musing
eyes, the normal landscape, the green picture of
the world. In Shakespeare’s day, doubtless, the coat
of nature was far from being so prettily trimmed
as it is now; but there is one place, nevertheless,
which, as he passes it in the summer twilight, the
traveller does his best to believe unaltered. I allude
of course to Charlecote park, whose venerable verdure
seems a survival from an earlier England and
whose innumerable acres, stretching away, in the
early evening, to vaguely seen Tudor walls, lie there
like the backward years receding to the age of Elizabeth.
It was, however, no part of my design in these
remarks to pause before so thickly besieged a shrine
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214" name="Page_214" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_214">214</a></span>
as this; and if I were to allude to Stratford it would
not be in connection with the fact that Shakespeare
planted there, to grow for ever, the torment of his
unguessed riddle. It would be rather to speak of
a delightful old house, near the Avon, which struck
me as the ideal home for a Shakespearean scholar,
or indeed for any passionate lover of the poet. Here,
with books and memories and the recurring reflection
that he had taken his daily walk across the
bridge at which you look from your windows straight
down an avenue of fine old trees, with an ever-closed
gate at the end of them and a carpet of turf stretched
over the decent drive—here, I say, with old brown
wainscotted chambers to live in, old polished doorsteps
to lead you from one to the other, deep window-seats
to sit in, with a play in your lap, here a person
for whom the cares of life should have resolved
themselves into a care for the greatest genius who
has represented and ornamented life might find a
very congruous asylum. Or, speaking a little wider
of the mark, the charming, rambling, low-gabled,
many-staired, much-panelled mansion would be a
very agreeable home for any person of taste who
should prefer an old house to a new. I find I am
talking about it quite like an auctioneer; but what
I chiefly had at heart was to commemorate the fact
that I had lunched there and, while I lunched, kept
saying to myself that there is nothing in the world
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215" name="Page_215" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_215">215</a></span>
so delightful as the happy accidents of old English
houses.
</p>

<p class="caption">CHARLECOTE PARK</p>
</div>

<p>
And yet that same day, on the edge of the Avon,
I found it in me to say that a new house too may
be a very charming affair. But I must add that the
new house I speak of had really such exceptional
advantages that it could not fairly be placed in the
scale. Besides, was it new after all? It must have
been, and yet one’s impression there was all of a
kind of silvered antiquity. The place stood upon
a decent Stratford road, from which it looked usual
enough; but when, after sitting a while in a charming
modern drawing-room, one stepped thoughtlessly
through an open window upon a verandah,
one found that the horizon of the morning call had
been wonderfully widened. I will not pretend to
detail all I saw after I stepped off the verandah;
suffice it that the spire and chancel of the beautiful
old church in which Shakespeare is buried, with the
Avon sweeping its base, were one of the elements of
the vision. Then there were the smoothest lawns
in the world stretching down to the edge of this
liquid slowness and making, where the water
touched them, a line as even as the rim of a champagne-glass—a
verge near which you inevitably
lingered to see the spire and the chancel (the church
was close at hand) among the well-grouped trees,
and look for their reflection in the river. The place
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216" name="Page_216" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_216">216</a></span>
was a garden of delight; it was a stage set for one of
Shakespeare’s comedies—for “Twelfth Night” or
“Much Ado.” Just across the river was a level
meadow, which rivalled the lawn on which I stood,
and this meadow seemed only the more essentially
a part of the scene by reason of the voluminous
sheep that were grazing on it. These sheep were
by no means mere edible mutton; they were poetic,
historic, romantic sheep; they were not there for
their weight or their wool, they were there for their
presence and their compositional value, and they
visibly knew it. And yet, knowing as they were, I
doubt whether the wisest old ram of the flock could
have told me how to explain why it was that this
happy mixture of lawn and river and mirrored spire
and blooming garden seemed to me for a quarter
of an hour the richest corner of England.
</p>

<p>
If Warwickshire is Shakespeare’s country, I found
myself not dodging the consciousness that it is also
George Eliot’s. The author of “Adam Bede” and
“Middlemarch” has called the rural background
of those admirable fictions by another name, but
I believe it long ago ceased to be a secret that her
native Warwickshire had been in her intention. The
stranger who treads its eternal stretched velvet recognises
at every turn the elements of George Eliot’s
novels—especially when he carries himself back
in imagination to the Warwickshire of forty years
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217" name="Page_217" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_217">217</a></span>
ago. He says to himself that it would be impossible
to conceive anything—anything equally rural—more
sturdily central, more densely definite. It was
in one of the old nestling farmhouses, beyond a
hundred hedgerows, that Hetty Sorrel smiled into
her milk-pans as if she were looking for a reflection
of her pretty face; it was at the end of one of the
leafy-pillared avenues that poor Mrs. Casaubon
paced up and down with her many questions. The
country suggests in especial both the social and
the natural scenery of “Middlemarch.” There
must be many a genially perverse old Mr. Brooke
there yet, and whether there are many Dorotheas
or not, there must be many a well-featured and
well-acred young country gentleman, of the pattern
of Sir James Chettam, who, as he rides along the
leafy lanes, softly cudgels his brain to know why
a clever girl shouldn’t wish to marry him. But I
doubt whether there be many Dorotheas, and I
suspect that the Sir James Chettams of the county
are not often pushed to that intensity of meditation.
You feel, however, that George Eliot could not have
placed her heroine in a local medium better fitted
to throw her fine impatience into relief—a community
more likely to be startled and perplexed by
a questioning attitude on the part of a well-housed
and well-fed young gentlewoman.
</p>

<p>
Among the edifying days that I spent in these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218" name="Page_218" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_218">218</a></span>
neighbourhoods there is one in especial of which
I should like to give a detailed account. But I find
on consulting my memory that the details have
melted away into the single deep impression of a
perfect ripeness of civilisation. It was a long excursion,
by rail and by carriage, for the purpose of seeing
three extremely interesting old country-houses. Our
errand led us, in the first place, into Oxfordshire,
through the ancient market-town of Banbury, where
of course we made a point of looking out for the
Cross referred to in the famous nursery-rhyme.
It stood there in the most natural manner—though
I am afraid it has been “done up”—with various
antique gables around it, from one of whose exiguous
windows the young person appealed to in the
rhyme may have looked at the old woman as she
rode, and heard the music of her bells. The houses
we went to see have not a national reputation; they
are simply interwoven figures in the rich pattern
of the Midlands. They have indeed a local renown,
but they are not thought of as unexampled, still
less as abnormal, and the stranger has a feeling
that his surprises and ecstasies are held to betray
the existence, on his part, of a blank background.
Such places, to a Warwickshire mind of good habits,
must appear the pillars and props of a heaven-appointed
order of things; and accordingly, in
a land on which heaven smiles, they are as natural
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219" name="Page_219" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_219">219</a></span>
as the geology of the county or the supply of mutton.
But nothing could well give a stranger a stronger
impression of the wealth of England in such matters—of
the interminable list of her territorial homes—than
this fact that the so eminent specimens I
speak of should have but a limited fame, should not
be lions of the first magnitude. Of one of them, the
finest in the group, one of my companions, who
lived but twenty miles away, had never even heard.
Such a place was not thought a subject for local
swagger. Its peers and mates are scattered all over
the country; half of them are not even mentioned in
the county guidebooks. You stumble upon them in
a drive or a walk. You catch a glimpse of an ivied
front at some midmost point of wide acres, and,
taking your way, by leave of a serious old woman at
a lodge-gate, along an overarching avenue, you find
yourself introduced to an edifice so human-looking
in its beauty that it seems for the occasion fairly to
reconcile art and morality.
</p>

<p>
To Broughton Castle, the first seen in this beautiful
group, I must do no more than allude; but this
is not because I failed to think it, as I think every
house I see, the most delightful habitation in England.
It lies rather low, and its woods and pastures
slope down to it; it has a deep, clear moat all round
it, spanned by a bridge that passes under a charming
old gate-tower, and nothing can be sweeter than to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220" name="Page_220" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_220">220</a></span>
see its clustered walls of yellow-brown stone so
sharply islanded while its gardens bloom on the
other side of the water. Like several other houses
in this part of the country, Broughton Castle played
a part (on the Parliamentary side) in the civil wars,
and not the least interesting features of its beautiful
interior are the several mementoes of Cromwell’s
station there. It was within a moderate drive of this
place that in 1642 the battle of Edgehill was fought—the
first great battle of the war—and gained
by neither party. We went to see the battlefield,
where an ancient tower and an artificial ruin (of all
things in the world) have been erected for the entertainment
of convivial visitors. These ornaments are
perched upon the edge of a slope which commands
a view of the exact scene of the contest, upwards of a
mile away. I looked in the direction indicated and
saw misty meadows a little greener perhaps than
usual and colonnades of elms a trifle denser. After
this we paid our respects to another old house which
is full of memories and suggestions of that most
dramatic period of English history. But of Compton
Wyniates (the name of this seat of enchantment)
I despair of giving any coherent or adequate account.
It belongs to the Marquis of Northampton,
and it stands empty all the year round. It sits on
the grass at the bottom of a wooded hollow, and the
glades of a superb old park go wandering upward
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221" name="Page_221" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_221">221</a></span>
away from it. When I came out in front of the house
from a short and steep but stately avenue I said to
myself that here surely we had arrived at the farthest
limits of what ivy-smothered brickwork and
weather-beaten gables, conscious old windows and
clustered mossy roofs can accomplish for the eye.
It is impossible to imagine a more finished picture.
And its air of solitude and delicate decay—of having
been dropped into its grassy hollow as an ancient
jewel is deposited upon a cushion, and being shut
in from the world and back into the past by its
circling woods—all this drives the impression well
home. The house is not large, as great houses go,
and it sits, as I have said, upon the grass, without
even a flagging or a footpath to conduct you from
the point where the avenue stops to the beautiful
sculptured doorway which admits you into the
small, quaint inner court. From this court you are
at liberty to pass through the crookedest series of
oaken halls and chambers, adorned with treasures of
old wainscotting and elaborate doors and chimney-pieces.
Outside, you may walk all round the house
on a grassy bank, which is raised above the level on
which it stands, and find it from every point of view
a more charming composition. I should not omit
to mention that Compton Wyniates is supposed to
have been in Scott’s eye when he described the
dwelling of the old royalist knight in “Woodstock.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222" name="Page_222" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_222">222</a></span>
In this case he simply transferred the house to the
other side of the county. He has indeed given several
of the features of the place, but he has not given
what one may call its colour. I must add that if Sir
Walter could not give the colour of Compton Wyniates,
it is useless for any other writer to try. It is
a matter for the brush and not for the pen.
</p>

<p>
And what shall I say of the colour of Wroxton
Abbey, which we visited last in order and which in
the thickening twilight, as we approached its great
ivy-muffled face, laid on the mind the burden of its
felicity? Wroxton Abbey, as it stands, is a house
of about the same period as Compton Wyniates—the
latter years, I suppose, of the sixteenth century.
But it is quite another affair. The place is
inhabited, “kept up,” full of the most interesting
and most splendid detail. Its happy occupants,
however, were fortunately not in the act of staying
there (happy occupants, in England, are almost
always absent), and the house was exhibited with
a civility worthy of its merit. Everything that in the
material line can render life noble and charming
has been gathered into it with a profusion which
makes the whole place a monument to past opportunity.
As I wandered from one rich room to
another and looked at these things, that intimate
appeal to the romantic sense which I just mentioned
was mercilessly emphasised. But who can tell the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223" name="Page_223" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_223">223</a></span>
story of the romantic sense when that adventurer
really rises to the occasion—takes its ease in an
old English country-house while the twilight darkens
the corners of expressive rooms and the victim of
the scene, pausing at the window, turns his glance
from the observing portrait of a handsome ancestral
face and sees the great soft billows of the lawn melt
away into the park?

<h2>
ABBEYS AND CASTLES
</h2>

<p>
It is a frequent perception with the stranger in
England that the beauty and interest of the
country are private property and that to get access
to them a key is always needed. The key may be
large or it may be small, but it must be something
that will turn a lock. Of the things that contribute
to the happiness of an American observer in these
tantalising conditions, I can think of very few that
do not come under this definition of private property.
When I have mentioned the hedgerows and
the churches I have almost exhausted the list. You
can enjoy a hedgerow from the public road, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226" name="Page_226" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_226">226</a></span>
I suppose that even if you are a Dissenter you may
enjoy a Norman abbey from the street. If therefore
you talk of anything beautiful in England, the
presumption will be that it is private; and indeed
such is my admiration of this delightful country that
I feel inclined to say that if you talk of anything
private the presumption will be that it is beautiful.
This is something of a dilemma. When the observer
permits himself to commemorate charming
impressions he is in danger of giving to the world
the fruits of friendship and hospitality. When on the
other hand he withholds his impression he lets something
admirable slip away without having marked
its passage, without having done it proper honour.
He ends by mingling discretion with enthusiasm,
and he says to himself that it is not treating a country
ill to talk of its treasures when the mention of
each has tacit reference to some kindness conferred.
</p>

<p>
The impressions I have in mind in writing these
lines were gathered in a part of England of which
I had not before had even a traveller’s glimpse, but
as to which, after a day or two, I found myself quite
ready to agree with a friend who lived there and
who knew and loved it well, when he said very
frankly, “I do believe it is the loveliest corner of
the world!” This was not a dictum to quarrel about,
and while I was in the neighbourhood I was quite of
his opinion. I felt I might easily come to care for it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227" name="Page_227" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_227">227</a></span>
very much as he cared for it; I had a glimpse of
the kind of romantic passion such a country may
inspire. It is a capital example of that density of
feature which is the great characteristic of English
scenery. There are no waste details; everything in
the landscape is something particular—has a history,
has played a part, has a value to the imagination.
It is a region of hills and blue undulations,
and, though none of the hills are high, all of them
are interesting,—interesting as such things are
interesting in an old, small country, by a kind of
exquisite modulation, something suggesting that outline
and colouring have been retouched and refined
by the hand of time. Independently of its castles and
abbeys, the definite relics of the ages, such a landscape
seems charged and interfused. It has, has
always had, human relations and is intimately conscious
of them. That little speech about the loveliness
of his county, or of his own part of his county,
was made to me by my companion as we walked up
the grassy slope of a hill, or “edge,” as it is called
there, from the crest of which we seemed in an
instant to look away over most of the remainder of
England. Certainly one would have grown to love
such a view as that quite in the same way as to love
some magnificent yet sensitive friend. The “edge”
plunged down suddenly, as if the corresponding
slope on the other side had been excavated, and you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228" name="Page_228" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_228">228</a></span>
might follow the long ridge for the space of an afternoon’s
walk with this vast, charming prospect before
your eyes. Looking across an English county into
the next but one is a very pretty entertainment, the
county seeming by no means so small as might be
supposed. How can a county seem small in which,
from such a vantage-point as the one I speak of, you
see, as a darker patch across the lighter green, the
great territory of one of the greatest representatives
of territorial greatness? These things constitute
immensities, and beyond them are blue undulations
of varying tone, and then another bosky province
which furnishes forth, as you are told, the residential
and other umbrage of another magnate. And
to right and left of these, in wooded expanses, lie
other domains of equal consequence. It was therefore
not the smallness but the vastness of the country
that struck me, and I was not at all in the mood of a
certain American who once, in my hearing, burst out
laughing at an English answer to my enquiry as to
whether my interlocutor often saw Mr. B——. “Oh
no,” the answer had been, “we never see him: he
lives away off in the West.” It was the western part
of his county our friend meant, and my American
humourist found matter for infinite jest in his meaning.
“I should as soon think,” he remarked, “of
talking of my own west or east foot.”
</p>

<p>
I do not think, even, that my sensibility to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229" name="Page_229" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_229">229</a></span>
charm of this delightful region—for its hillside
prospect of old red farmhouses lighting up the dark-green
bottoms, of gables and chimney-tops of great
houses peeping above miles of woodland, and, in the
vague places of the horizon, of far-away towns and
sites that one had always heard of—was conditioned
upon having “property” in the neighbourhood,
so that the little girls in the town should suddenly
drop curtsies to me in the street; though that
too would certainly have been pleasant. At the same
time having a little property would without doubt
have made the attachment stronger. People who
wander about the world without money in their
pockets indulge in dreams—dreams of the things
they would buy if their pockets were workable.
These dreams are very apt to have relation to a good
estate in any neighbourhood in which the wanderer
may happen to find himself. For myself, I have
never been in a country so unattractive that I didn’t
find myself “drawn” to its most exemplary mansion.
In New England and other portions of the
United States I have felt my heart go out to the
Greek temple, the small Parthenon, in white-painted
wood; in Italy I have made imaginary proposals
for the yellow-walled villa with statues on the roof.
My fancy, in England, has seldom fluttered so high
as the very best house, but it has again and again
hovered about one of the quiet places, unknown to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230" name="Page_230" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_230">230</a></span>
fame, which are locally spoken of as merely “good.”
There was one in especial, in the neighbourhood I
allude to, as to which the dream of having impossibly
acquired it from an embarrassed owner kept melting
into the vision of “moving in” on the morrow.
I saw this place unfortunately, to small advantage;
I saw it in the rain, but I am glad fine weather
didn’t meddle with the affair, for the irritation of
envy might in this case have poisoned the impression.
It was a long, wet Sunday, and the waters
were deep. I had been in the house all day, for the
weather can best be described by my saying that it
had been deemed to exonerate us from church. But
in the afternoon, the prospective interval between
lunch and tea assuming formidable proportions,
my host took me a walk, and in the course of our
walk he led me into a park which he described as
“the paradise of a small English country-gentleman.”
It was indeed a modern Eden, and the trees
might have been trees of knowledge. They were of
high antiquity and magnificent girth and stature;
they were strewn over the grassy levels in extraordinary
profusion, and scattered upon and down the
slopes in a fashion than which I have seen nothing
more felicitous since I last looked at the chestnuts
above the Lake of Como. The point was that
the property was small, but that one could perceive
nowhere any limit. Shortly before we turned into
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231" name="Page_231" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_231">231</a></span>
the park the rain had renewed itself, so that we were
awkwardly wet and muddy; but, being near the
house, my companion proposed to leave his card in
a neighbourly way. The house was most agreeable;
it stood on a kind of terrace, in the middle of a lawn
and garden, and the terrace overhung one of the
most copious rivers in England, as well as looking
across to those blue undulations of which I have
already spoken. On the terrace also was a piece of
ornamental water, and there was a small iron paling
to divide the lawn from the park. All this I beheld in
the rain. My companion gave his card to the butler
with the remark that we were too much bespattered
to come in, and we turned away to complete our circuit.
As we turned away I became acutely conscious
of what I should have been tempted to call the
cruelty of this proceeding. My imagination gauged
the whole position. It was a blank, a blighted Sunday
afternoon—no one could come. The house was
charming, the terrace delightful, the oaks magnificent,
the view most interesting. But the whole thing
confessed to the blankness if not to the dulness. In
the house was a drawing-room, and in the drawing-room
was—by which I meant <i>must be</i>—an English
lady, a perfectly harmonious figure. There was
nothing fatuous in believing that on this rainy
Sunday afternoon it would not please her to be told
that two gentlemen had walked across the country to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232" name="Page_232" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_232">232</a></span>
her door only to go through the ceremony of leaving
a card. Therefore, when, before we had gone many
yards, I heard the butler hurrying after us, I felt
how just my sentiment of the situation had been.
Of course we went back, and I carried my muddy
boots into the drawing-room—just the drawing-room
I had imagined—where I found—I will not
say just the lady I had imagined, but a lady even
more in keeping. Indeed there were two ladies, one
of whom was staying in the house. In whatever company
you find yourself in England, you may always
be sure that some one present is “staying,” and you
come in due time to feel the abysses within the word.
The large windows of the drawing-room I speak of
looked away over the river to the blurred and blotted
hills, where the rain was drizzling and drifting. It
was very quiet, as I say; there was an air of large
leisure. If one wanted to do anything here, there
was evidently plenty of time—and indeed of every
other appliance—to do it. The two ladies talked
about “town:” that is what people talk about in
the country. If I were disposed I might represent
them as talking with a positive pathos of yearning.
At all events I asked myself how it could be
that one should live in this charming place and
trouble one’s head about what was going on in
London in July. Then we had fine strong tea and
bread and butter.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233" name="Page_233" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_233">233</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I returned to the habitation of my friend—for
I too was guilty of “staying”—through an old
Norman portal, massively arched and quaintly
sculptured, across whose hollow threshold the eye of
fancy might see the ghosts of monks and the shadows
of abbots pass noiselessly to and fro. This aperture
admits you to a beautiful ambulatory of the
thirteenth century—a long stone gallery or cloister,
repeated in two stories, with the interstices of its
traceries now glazed, but with its long, low, narrow,
charming vista still perfect and picturesque, with
its flags worn away by monkish sandals and with
huge round-arched doorways opening from its inner
side into great rooms roofed like cathedrals. These
rooms are furnished with narrow windows, of almost
defensive aspect, set in embrasures three feet deep
and ornamented with little grotesque mediæval
faces. To see one of the small monkish masks grinning
at you while you dress and undress, or while
you look up in the intervals of inspiration from your
letter-writing, is a mere detail in the entertainment
of living in a <i>ci-devant</i> priory. This entertainment
is inexhaustible; for every step you take in such a
house confronts you in one way or another with the
remote past. You devour the documentary, you inhale
the historic. Adjoining the house is a beautiful
ruin, part of the walls and windows and bases of the
piers of the magnificent church administered by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234" name="Page_234" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_234">234</a></span>
predecessor of your host, the mitred abbot. These
relics are very desultory, but they are still abundant,
and they testify to the great scale and the stately
beauty of the abbey. You may lie upon the grass
at the base of an ivied fragment, measure the girth
of the great stumps of the central columns, half-smothered
in soft creepers, and think how strange
it is that in this quiet hollow, in the midst of lonely
hills, so exquisite and elaborate a work of art should
have risen. It is but an hour’s walk to another great
ruin, which has held together more completely.
There the central tower stands erect to half its altitude
and the round arches and massive pillars of the
nave make a perfect vista on the unencumbered turf.
You get an impression that when Catholic England
was in her prime great abbeys were as thick as milestones.
By native amateurs even now the region is
called “wild,” though to American eyes it seems
almost suburban in its smoothness and finish. There
is a noiseless little railway running through the valley,
and there is an ancient little town at the abbey
gates—a town indeed with no great din of vehicles,
but with goodly brick houses, with a dozen
“publics,” with tidy, whitewashed cottages, and
with little girls, as I have said, bobbing curtsies in
the street. Yet even now, if one had wound one’s
way into the valley by the railroad, it would be
rather a surprise to find a great architectural display
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235" name="Page_235" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_235">235</a></span>
in a setting so peaceful and pastoral. How
impressive then must the beautiful church have been
in the days of its prosperity, when the pilgrim came
down to it from the grassy hillside and its bells made
the stillness sensible! The abbey was in those days
a great affair; it sprawled, as my companion said,
all over the place. As you walk away from it you
think you have got to the end of its geography, but
you encounter it still in the shape of a rugged outhouse
enriched with an early-English arch, of an
ancient well hidden in a kind of sculptured cavern.
It is noticeable that even if you are a traveller from
a land where there are no early-English—and
indeed few late-English—arches, and where the
well-covers are, at their hoariest, of fresh-looking
shingles, you grow used with little delay to all this
antiquity. Anything very old seems extremely natural;
there is nothing we suffer to get so near us as
the tokens of the remote. It is not too much to say
that after spending twenty-four hours in a house that
is six hundred years old you seem yourself to have
lived in it six hundred years. You seem yourself to
have hollowed the flags with your tread and to have
polished the oak with your touch. You walk along
the little stone gallery where the monks used to pace,
looking out of the gothic window-places at their
beautiful church, and you pause at the big, round,
rugged doorway that admits you to what is now the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236" name="Page_236" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_236">236</a></span>
drawing-room. The massive step by which you
ascend to the threshold is a trifle crooked, as it
should be; the lintels are cracked and worn by the
myriad-fingered years. This strikes your casual
glance. You look up and down the miniature cloister
before you pass in; it seems wonderfully old and
queer. Then you turn into the drawing-room, where
you find modern conversation and late publications
and the prospect of dinner. The new life and the old
have melted together; there is no dividing-line. In
the drawing-room wall is a queer funnel-shaped
hole, with the broad end inward, like a small casemate.
You ask what it is, but people have forgotten.
It is something of the monks; it is a mere detail.
After dinner you are told that there is of course
a ghost, a grey friar who is seen in the dusky hours
at the end of passages. Sometimes the servants see
him; they afterwards go surreptitiously to sleep in
the village. Then, when you take your chamber-candle
and go wandering bedward by a short cut
through empty rooms, you are conscious of an attitude
toward the grey friar which you hardly know
whether to read as a fond hope or as a great fear.

<p class="caption">LUDLOW CASTLE; FROM THE MOAT</p>
</div>

<p>
A friend of mine, an American, who knew this
country, had told me not to fail, while I was in the
neighbourhood, to go to Stokesay and two or three
other places. “Edward IV and Elizabeth,” he said,
“are still hanging about there.” So admonished, I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237" name="Page_237" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_237">237</a></span>
made a point of going at least to Stokesay, and I saw
quite what my friend meant. Edward IV and Elizabeth
indeed are still to be met almost anywhere in
the county; as regards domestic architecture few
parts of England are still more vividly old-English.
I have rarely had, for a couple of hours, the sensation
of dropping back personally into the past so
straight as while I lay on the grass beside the well
in the little sunny court of this small castle and lazily
appreciated the still definite details of mediæval
life. The place is a capital example of a small <i>gentil-hommière</i>
of the thirteenth century. It has a good
deep moat, now filled with wild verdure, and a curious
gate-house of a much later period—the period
when the defensive attitude had been wellnigh abandoned.
This gate-house, which is not in the least in
the style of the habitation, but gabled and heavily
timbered, with quaint cross-beams protruding from
surfaces of coarse white plaster, is a very effective
anomaly in regard to the little grey fortress on the
other side of the court. I call this a fortress, but it is
a fortress which might easily have been taken, and
it must have assumed its present shape at a time
when people had ceased to peer through narrow slits
at possible besiegers. There are slits in the outer
walls for such peering, but they are noticeably broad
and not particularly oblique, and might easily have
been applied to the uses of a peaceful parley. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238" name="Page_238" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_238">238</a></span>
part of the charm of the place; human life there
must have lost an earlier grimness; it was lived in
by people who were beginning to believe in good
intentions. They must have lived very much together;
that is one of the most obvious reflections
in the court of a mediæval dwelling. The court was
not always grassy and empty, as it is now, with only
a couple of gentlemen in search of impressions lying
at their length, one of them handling a wine-flask
that colours the clear water drawn from the well into
a couple of tumblers by a decent, rosy, smiling, talking
old woman who has come bustling out of the
gate-house and who has a large, dropsical, innocent
husband standing about on crutches in the sun and
making no sign when you ask after his health. This
poor man has reached that ultimate depth of human
simplicity at which even a chance to talk about one’s
ailments is not appreciated. But the civil old woman
talks for every one, even for an artist who has come
out of one of the rooms, where I see him afterward
reproducing its mouldering repose. The rooms are
all unoccupied and in a state of extreme decay,
though the castle is, as yet, far from being a ruin.
From one of the windows I see a young lady sitting
under a tree, across a meadow, with her knees up,
dipping something into her mouth. It is indubitably
a camel’s hair paint-brush; the young lady is inevitably
sketching. These are the only besiegers to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239" name="Page_239" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_239">239</a></span>
which the place is exposed now, and they can do no
great harm, as I doubt whether the young lady’s
aim is very good. We wandered about the empty
interior, thinking it a pity such things should fall to
pieces. There is a beautiful great hall—great, that
is, for a small castle (it would be extremely handsome
in a modern house)—with tall, ecclesiastical-looking
windows, and a long staircase at one end,
which climbs against the wall into a spacious bedroom.
You may still apprehend very well the main
lines of that simpler life; and it must be said that,
simpler though it was, it was apparently by no means
destitute of many of our own conveniences. The
chamber at the top of the staircase ascending from
the hall is charming still, with its irregular shape, its
low-browed ceiling, its cupboards in the walls, its
deep bay window formed of a series of small lattices.
You can fancy people stepping out from it upon the
platform of the staircase, whose rugged wooden logs,
by way of steps, and solid, deeply-guttered handrail,
still remain. They looked down into the hall,
where, I take it, there was always a congregation of
retainers, much lounging and waiting and passing
to and fro, with a door open into the court. The
court, as I said just now, was not the grassy, æsthetic
spot which you may find it at present of a summer’s
day; there were beasts tethered in it, and hustling
men-at-arms, and the earth was trampled into puddles.

But my lord or my lady, looking down from
the chamber-door, commanded the position and, no
doubt, issued their orders accordingly. The sight of
the groups on the floor beneath, the calling up and
down, the oaken tables spread and the brazier in the
middle—all this seemed present again; and it was
not difficult to pursue the historic vision through the
rest of the building—through the portion which
connected the great hall with the tower (where the
confederate of the sketching young lady without had
set up the peaceful three-legged engine of his craft);
through the dusky, roughly circular rooms of the
tower itself, and up the corkscrew staircase of the
same to that most charming part of every old castle,
where visions must leap away off the battlements to
elude you—the bright, dizzy platform at the tower-top,
the place where the castle-standard hung and
the vigilant inmates surveyed the approaches. Here,
always, you really overtake the impression of the
place—here, in the sunny stillness, it seems to pause,
panting a little, and give itself up.

<p>
It was not only at Stokesay that I lingered a
while on the summit of the keep to enjoy the complete
impression so overtaken. I spent such another
half-hour at Ludlow, which is a much grander and
more famous monument. Ludlow, however, is a
ruin—the most impressive and magnificent of ruins.
The charming old town and the admirable castle
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241" name="Page_241" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_241">241</a></span>
form a capital object of pilgrimage. Ludlow is an
excellent example of a small English provincial
town that has not been soiled and disfigured by
industry; it exhibits no tall chimneys and smoke-streamers,
no attendant purlieus and slums. The
little city is perched upon a hill near which the
goodly Severn wanders, and it has a remarkable air
of civic dignity. Its streets are wide and clean, empty
and a little grass-grown, and bordered with spacious,
mildly-ornamental brick houses which look as if
there had been more going on in them in the first
decade of the century than there is in the present,
but which can still nevertheless hold up their heads
and keep their window-panes clear, their knockers
brilliant, and their door-steps whitened. The place
seems to say that some hundred years ago it was
the centre of a large provincial society and that this
society was very “good” of its kind. It must have
transported itself to Ludlow for the season—in
rumbling coaches and heavy curricles—and there
entertained itself in decent emulation of that more
majestic capital which a choice of railway lines had
not as yet placed within its immediate reach. It had
balls at the assembly rooms; it had Mrs. Siddons to
play; it had Catalani to sing. Miss Burney’s and
Miss Austen’s heroines might perfectly well have
had their first love-affair there; a journey to Ludlow
would certainly have been a great event to Fanny
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242" name="Page_242" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_242">242</a></span>
Price or Emma Woodhouse, or even to those more
romantically-connected young ladies Evelina and
Cecilia. It is a place on which a provincial aristocracy
has left so sensible a stamp as to enable you
to measure both the grand manners and the small
ways. It is a very interesting array of houses of the
period after the poetry of domestic architecture had
begun to wane and before the vulgarity had come—a
fine familiar classic prose. Such places, such
houses, such relics and intimations, carry us back
to the near antiquity of that pre-Victorian England
which it is still easy for a stranger to picture with
a certain vividness, thanks to the partial survival
of many of its characteristics. It is still easier for
a stranger who has dwelt a time in England to form
an idea of the tone, the habits, the aspect of the
social life before its classic insularity had begun to
wane, as all observers agree that it did about thirty
years ago. It is true that the mental operation in
this matter reduces itself to our imaging some of
the things which form the peculiar national notes as
infinitely exaggerated: the rigidly aristocratic constitution
of society, the unæsthetic temper of the
people, the small public fund of convenience, of
elegance. Let an old gentleman of conservative
tastes, who can remember the century’s youth, talk
to you at a club <i>temporis acti</i>—tell you wherein it
is that from his own point of view London, as a residence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243" name="Page_243" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_243">243</a></span>
for a gentleman, has done nothing but fall
off for the last forty years. You will listen, of course,
with an air of decent sympathy, but privately you
will say to yourself how difficult a place of sojourn
London must have been in those days for the traveller
from other countries—how little cosmopolitan,
how bound, in a thousand ways, with narrowness of
custom. What was true of the great city at that
time was of course doubly true of the provinces;
and a community of the type of Ludlow must have
been a kind of focus of insular propriety. Even then,
however, the irritated alien would have had the
magnificent ruins of the castle to dream himself
back into good humour in. They would effectually
have transported him beyond all waning or waxing
Philistinisms.

ENGLISH VIGNETTES
</h2>

<h3 class="lowpad">
I
</h3>

<p>
Toward the last of April, in Monmouthshire,
the primroses were as big as your fist. I say in
Monmouthshire, because I believe that a certain
grassy mountain which I gave myself the pleasure of
climbing and to which I took my way across the
charming country, through lanes where the hedges
were perched upon blooming banks, lay within the
borders of this ancient province. It was the festive
Eastertide, and a pretext for leaving London had
not been wanting. Of course it rained—it rained
a good deal—for man and the weather are usually
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246" name="Page_246" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_246">246</a></span>
at cross-purposes. But there were intervals of light
and warmth, and in England a couple of hours of
brightness islanded in moisture assert their independence
and leave an uncompromised memory.
These reprieves were even of longer duration; that
whole morning for instance on which, with a companion,
I scrambled up the little Skirrid. One had a
feeling that one was very far from London; as in fact
one was, after six or seven hours in a swift, straight
train. In England this is a long span; it seemed to
justify the half-reluctant confession, which I heard
constantly made, that the country was extremely
“wild.” There is wildness and wildness, I thought;
and though I had not been a great explorer I compared
this rough district with several neighbourhoods
in another part of the world that passed for tame.
I went even so far as to wish that some of its ruder
features might be transplanted to that relatively
unregulated landscape and commingled with its
suburban savagery. We were close to the Welsh
border, and a dozen little mountains in the distance
were peeping over each other’s shoulders, but nature
was open to the charge of no worse disorder than
this. The Skirrid (I like to repeat the name) wore,
it is true, at a distance, the aspect of a magnified
extinguisher; but when, after a bright, breezy walk
through lane and meadow, we had scrambled over
the last of the thickly-flowering hedges which lay
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247" name="Page_247" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_247">247</a></span>
around its shoulders like loosened strings of coral
and begun to ascend the grassy cone (very much in
the attitude of Nebuchadnezzar), it proved as
smooth-faced as a garden-mound. Hard by, on the
flanks of other hills, were troops of browsing sheep,
and the only thing that confessed in the least to a
point or an edge was the strong, damp wind. But
even the high breeze was good-humoured and only
wanted something to play with, blowing about the
pearly morning mists that were airing themselves
upon neighbouring ridges and shaking the vaporous
veil that fluttered down in the valley over the picturesque
little town of Abergavenny. A breezy, grassy
English hill-top, looking down on a country full of
suggestive names and ancient memories and implied
stories (especially if you are exhilarated by a beautiful
walk and have a flask in your pocket), shows
you the world as a very smooth place, fairly rubbed
so by human use.
</p>

<p>
I was warned away from church, on Sunday, by
my mistrust of its mediæval chill—lumbago there
was so clearly catching. In the still hours, when the
roads and lanes were empty, I simply walked to the
churchyard and sat upon one of the sun-warmed
gravestones. I say the roads were empty, but they
were peopled with the big primroses I just now
spoke of—primroses of the size of ripe apples and
yet, in spite of their rank growth, of as pale and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248" name="Page_248" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_248">248</a></span>
tender a yellow as if their gold had been diluted with
silver. It was indeed a mixture of gold and silver,
for there was a wealth of the white wood-anemone
as well, and these delicate flowers, each of so perfect
a coinage, were tumbled along the green wayside
as if a prince had been scattering largess. The
outside of an old English country church in service-time
is a very pleasant place; and this is as near as I
often dare approach the celebration of the Anglican
mysteries. A just sufficient sense of their august
character may be gathered from that vague sound of
village music which makes its way out into the stillness
and from the perusal of those portions of the
Prayer-Book which are inscribed upon mouldering
slabs and dislocated headstones. The church I speak
of was a beautiful specimen of its kind—intensely
aged, variously patched, but still solid and useful
and with no touch of restoration. It was very big
and massive and, hidden away in the fields, had a
kind of lonely grandeur; there was nothing in particular
near it but its out-of-the-world little parsonage.
It was only one of ten thousand; I had seen
a hundred such before. But I watched the watery
sunshine upon the rugosities of its ancient masonry;
I stood a while in the shade of two or three spreading
yews which stretched their black arms over
graves decorated for Easter, according to the custom
of that country, with garlands of primrose and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249" name="Page_249" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_249">249</a></span>
dog-violet; and I reflected that in a “wild” region
it was a blessing to have so quiet a place of refuge
as that.
</p>

<p>
Later I chanced upon a couple of other asylums
which were more spacious and no less tranquil.
Both of them were old country-houses, and each in
its way was charming. One was a half-modernised
feudal dwelling, lying in a wooded hollow—a large
concavity filled with a delightful old park. The
house had a long grey façade and half a dozen
towers, and the usual supply of ivy and of clustered
chimneys relieved against a background of rook-haunted
elms. But the windows were all closed
and the avenue was untrodden; the house was the
property of a lady who could not afford to live in it
in becoming state and who had let it, furnished, to
a rich young man, “for the shooting.” The rich
young man occupied it but for three weeks in the
year and for the rest of the time left it a prey to the
hungry gaze of the passing stranger, the would-be
redresser of æsthetic wrongs. It seemed a great
æsthetic wrong that so charming a place should not
be a conscious, sentient home. In England all this
is very common. It takes a great many plain people
to keep a “perfect” gentleman going; it takes a
great deal of wasted sweetness to make up a saved
property. It is true that, in the other case I speak
of, the sweetness, which here was even greater, was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250" name="Page_250" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_250">250</a></span>
less sensibly squandered. If there was no one else in
the house at least there were ghosts. It had a dark
red front and grim-looking gables; it was perched
upon a vague terrace, quite high in the air, which
was reached by steep, crooked, mossy steps. Beneath
these steps was an ancient bit of garden, and
from the hither side of the garden stretched a great
expanse of turf. Out of the midst of the turf sprang
a magnificent avenue of Scotch firs—a perfect imitation
of the Italian stone-pine. It looked like the
Villa Borghese transplanted to the Welsh hills. The
huge, smooth stems, in their double row, were
crowned with dark parasols. In the Scotch fir or the
Italian pine there is always an element of oddity;
the open umbrella in a rainy country is not a poetical
analogy, and the case is not better if you compare
the tree to a colossal mushroom. But, without
analogies, there was something very striking in the
effect of this enormous, rigid vista, and in the grassy
carpet of the avenue, with the dusky, lonely, high-featured
house looking down upon it. There was
something solemn and tragical; the place was made
to the hand of a story-seeker, who might have found
his characters within, as, the leaden lattices being
open, the actors seemed ready for the stage.

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
The Isle of Wight is at first disappointing. I
wondered why it should be, and then I found the
reason in the influence of the detestable little railway.
There can be no doubt that a railway in the
Isle of Wight is a gross impertinence, is in evident
contravention to the natural style of the place. The
place is pure picture or is nothing at all. It is ornamental
only—it exists for exclamation and the
water-colour brush. It is separated by nature from
the dense railway system of the less diminutive
island, and is the corner of the world where a good
carriage-road is most in keeping. Never was a clearer
opportunity for sacrificing to prettiness; never was
a better chance for not making a railway. But now
there are twenty trains a day, so that the prettiness
is twenty times less. The island is so small that the
hideous embankments and tunnels are obtrusive;
the sight of them is as painful as it would be to see
a pedlar’s pack on the shoulders of a lovely woman.
This is your first impression as you travel (naturally
by the objectionable conveyance) from Ryde to Ventnor;
and the fact that the train rumbles along very
smoothly and stops at half a dozen little stations,
where the groups on the platform enable you to perceive
that the population consists almost exclusively
of gentlemen in costumes suggestive of unlimited
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252" name="Page_252" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_252">252</a></span>
leisure for attention to cravats and trousers (an
immensely large class in England), of old ladies
of the species denominated in France <i>rentières</i>, of
young ladies of the highly educated and sketching
variety, this circumstance fails to reconcile you to
the chartered cicatrix which forms your course. At
Ventnor, however, face to face with the sea, and
with the blooming shoulder of the Undercliff close
behind you, you lose sight to a certain extent of the
superfluities of civilisation. Not indeed that Ventnor
has not been diligently civilised. It is a formed and
finished watering-place, it has been reduced to a
due degree of cockneyfication. But the glittering
ocean remains, shimmering at moments with blue
and silver, and the large gorse-covered downs rise
superbly above it. Ventnor hangs upon the side
of a steep hill; and here and there it clings and
scrambles, is propped up and terraced, like one of
the bright-faced little towns that look down upon
the Mediterranean. To add to the Italian effect the
houses are all denominated villas, though it must be
added that nothing is less like an Italian villa than
an English. Those which ornament the successive
ledges at Ventnor are for the most part small semi-detached
boxes, predestined, even before they have
fairly come into the world, to the entertainment
of lodgers. They stand in serried rows all over the
place, with the finest names in the Peerage painted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253" name="Page_253" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_253">253</a></span>
upon their gate-posts. Their severe similarity of
aspect, however, is such that even the difference
between Plantagenet and Percival, between Montgomery
and Montmorency, is hardly sufficient to
enlighten the puzzled visitor. An English place
of recreation is more comfortable than an American;
in a Plantagenet villa the art of receiving
“summer guests” has usually been brought to a
higher perfection than in an American rural hotel.
But what strikes an American, with regard to even
so charmingly-nestled a little town as Ventnor, is
that it is far less natural, less pastoral and bosky
than his own fond image of a summer retreat.
There is too much brick and mortar; there are too
many smoking chimneys and shops and public-houses;
there are no woods nor brooks nor lonely
headlands; there is none of the virginal stillness of
nature. Instead of these things there is an esplanade
mostly paved with asphalt, bordered with benches
and little shops and provided with a German band.
To be just to Ventnor, however, I must hasten to
add that once you get away from the asphalt there is
a great deal of vegetation. The little village of Bonchurch,
which closely adjoins it, is buried in the
most elaborate verdure, muffled in the smoothest
lawns and the densest shrubbery. Bonchurch is
simply delicious and indeed in a manner quite absurd.
It is like a model village in imitative substances,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254" name="Page_254" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_254">254</a></span>
kept in a big glass case; the turf might be of green
velvet and the foliage of cut paper. The villagers
are all happy gentlefolk, the cottages have plate-glass
windows, and the rose-trees on their walls look
as if tied up with ribbon “to match.” Passing from
Ventnor through the elegant umbrage of Bonchurch,
and keeping along the coast toward Shanklin, you
come to the prettiest part of the Undercliff, or in
other words to the prettiest place in the world. The
immense grassy cliffs which form the coast of the
island make what the French would call a “false
descent” to the sea. At a certain point the descent
is broken, so that a wide natural terrace, all over-tangled
with wild shrubs and flowers, hangs there
in mid-air, halfway above salt water. It is impossible
to imagine anything more charming than this
long, blooming platform, protected from the north
by huge green bluffs and plunging on the other side
into the murmuring tides. This delightful arrangement
constitutes for a distance of some fifteen miles
the south shore of the Isle of Wight; but the best
of it, as I have said, is to be found in the four or
five that separate Ventnor from Shanklin. Of a
lovely afternoon in April these four or five miles are
an admirable walk.

<p>
Of course you must first catch your lovely afternoon.
I caught one; in fact I caught two. On the
second I climbed up the downs and perceived that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255" name="Page_255" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_255">255</a></span>
it was possible to put their gorse-covered stretches
to still other than pedestrian uses—to devote them
to sedentary pleasures. A long lounge in the lee of a
stone wall, the lingering, fading afternoon light, the
reddening sky, the band of blue sea above the level-topped
bunches of gorse—these things, enjoyed as
an undertone to the conversation of an amiable compatriot,
seemed indeed a very sufficient substitute
for that primitive stillness of the absence of which
I ventured just now to complain.

<p>
It was probably a mistake to stop at Portsmouth.
I had done so, however, in obedience to a familiar
theory that seaport towns abound in local colour, in
curious types, in the quaint and the strange. But
these charms, it must be confessed, were signally
wanting to Portsmouth, along whose sordid streets
I strolled for an hour, vainly glancing about me for
an overhanging façade or a group of Maltese sailors.
I was distressed to perceive that a famous seaport
could be at once untidy and prosaic. Portsmouth
is dirty, but it is also dull. It may be roughly
divided into the dockyard and the public-houses.
The dockyard, into which I was unable to penetrate,
is a colossal enclosure, signalised externally by
a grim brick wall, as featureless as an empty blackboard.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256" name="Page_256" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_256">256</a></span>
The dockyard eats up the town, as it were,
and there is nothing left over but the gin-shops,
which the town drinks up. There is not even a
crooked old quay of any consequence, with brightly
patched houses looking out upon a forest of masts.
To begin with, there are no masts; and then there
are no polyglot sign-boards, no overhanging upper
stories, no outlandish parrots and macaws perched
in open lattices. I had another hour or so before my
train departed, and it would have gone hard with me
if I had not bethought myself of hiring a boat and
being pulled about in the harbour. Here a certain
amount of entertainment was to be found. There
were great ironclads, and white troop-ships that
looked vague and spectral, like the floating home
of the Flying Dutchman, and small, devilish vessels
whose mission was to project the infernal torpedo.
I coasted about these metallic islets, and then, to
eke out my entertainment, I boarded the Victory.
The Victory is an ancient frigate of enormous size,
which in the days of her glory carried I know not
how many hundred guns, but whose only function
now is to stand year after year in Portsmouth waters
and exhibit herself to the festive cockney. Bank-holiday
is now her great date; once upon a time it
was Trafalgar. The Victory, in short, was Nelson’s
ship; it was on her huge deck that he was struck,
and in her deep bowels he breathed his last. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257" name="Page_257" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_257">257</a></span>
venerable shell is provided with a company of
ushers, like the Tower of London or Westminster
Abbey, and is hardly less solid and spacious than
either of the land-vessels. A good man in uniform
did me the honours of the ship with a terrible displacement
of <i>h</i>’s, and there seemed something
strange in the way it had lapsed from its heroic
part. It had carried two hundred guns and a
mighty warrior, and boomed against the enemies of
England; it had been the scene of one of the most
thrilling and touching events in English history.
Now, it was hardly more than a mere source of income
to the Portsmouth watermen, an objective
point for Whitsuntide excursionists, a thing a pilgrim
from afar must allude to very casually, for fear
of seeming vulgar or even quite serious.
</p>

<p>
But I recouped myself, as they say, by stopping
afterwards at Chichester. In this dense and
various old England two places may be very near together
and yet strike a very different note. I knew
in a general way that this one had for its main sign
a cathedral, and indeed had caught the sign, in the
form of a beautiful spire, from the window of the
train. I had always regarded an afternoon in a
small cathedral-town as a high order of entertainment,
and a morning at Portsmouth had left me in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258" name="Page_258" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_258">258</a></span>
the mood for not missing such an exhibition. The
spire of Chichester at a little distance greatly resembles
that of Salisbury. It is on a smaller scale,
but it tapers upward with a delicate slimness which,
like that of its famous rival, makes a picture of the
level landscape in which it stands. Unlike the spire
of Salisbury, however, it has not at present the charm
of antiquity. A few years ago the old steeple collapsed
and tumbled into the church, and the present
structure is but a modern facsimile. The cathedral
is not of the highest interest; it is rather inexpressive,
and, except for a curious old detached bell-tower
which stands beside it, has no particular element
of unexpectedness. But an English cathedral of restricted
grandeur may yet be a very charming affair;
and I spent an hour or so circling round this highly
respectable edifice, with the spell of contemplation
unbroken by satiety. I approached it, from the
station, by the usual quiet red-brick street of the
usual cathedral town—a street of small, excellent
shops, before which, here and there, one of the
vehicles of the neighbouring gentry was drawn up
beside the curbstone while the grocer or the bookseller,
who had hurried out obsequiously, was waiting
upon the comfortable occupant. I went into
a bookseller’s to buy a Chichester guide, which
I perceived in the window; I found the shopkeeper
talking to a young curate in a soft hat. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259" name="Page_259" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_259">259</a></span>
guide seemed very desirable, though it appeared to
have been but scantily desired; it had been published
in the year 1841, and a very large remnant of the
edition, with a muslin back and a little white label
and paper-covered boards, was piled up on the
counter. It was dedicated, with terrible humility, to
the Duke of Richmond, and ornamented with primitive
woodcuts and steel plates; the ink had turned
brown and the page musty; and the style itself—that
of a provincial antiquary of upwards of forty
years ago penetrated with the grandeur of the aristocracy—had
grown rather sallow and stale. Nothing
could have been more mellifluous and urbane
than the young curate: he was arranging to have
the “Times” newspaper sent him every morning for
perusal. “So it will be a penny if it is fetched away
at noon?” he said, smiling very sweetly and with
the most gentlemanly voice possible; “and it will
be three halfpence if it is fetched away at four
o’clock?” At the top of the street, into which, with
my guide-book, I relapsed, was an old market-cross
of the fifteenth century—a florid, romantic little
structure. It consists of a stone pavilion, with open
sides and a number of pinnacles and crockets and
buttresses, besides a goodly medallion of the high-nosed
visage of Charles I, which was placed above
one of the arches, at the Restoration, in compensation
for the violent havoc wrought upon the little
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260" name="Page_260" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_260">260</a></span>
town by the Parliamentary soldiers, who had wrested
the place from the Royalists and who amused themselves,
in their grim fashion, with infinite hacking
and hewing in the cathedral. Here, to the left, the
cathedral discloses itself, lifting its smart grey
steeple out of a pleasant garden. Opposite to the
garden was the Dolphin or the Dragon—in fine
the most eligible inn. I must confess that for a time
it divided my attention with the cathedral, in virtue
of an ancient, musty parlour on the second floor,
with hunting-pictures hung above haircloth sofas;
of a red-faced waiter, in evening dress; of a big
round of cold beef and a tankard of ale. The prettiest
thing at Chichester is a charming little three-sided
cloister, attached to the cathedral, where, as
is usual in such places, you may sit upon a gravestone
amid the deep grass in the middle and measure
the great central mass of the church—the
large grey sides, the high foundations of the spire,
the parting of the nave and transept. From this
point the greatness of a cathedral seems more
complex and impressive. You watch the big
shadows slowly change their relations; you listen
to the cawing of rooks and the twittering of swallows;
you hear a slow footstep echoing in the
cloisters.

If Oxford were not the finest thing in England the
case would be clearer for Cambridge. It was clear
enough there, for that matter, to my imagination,
for thirty-six hours. To the barbaric mind, ambitious
of culture, Oxford is the usual image of the
happy reconciliation between research and acceptance.
It typifies to an American the union of science
and sense—of aspiration and ease. A German
university gives a greater impression of science and
an English country-house or an Italian villa a greater
impression of idle enjoyment; but in these cases, on
one side, knowledge is too rugged, and on the other
satisfaction is too trivial. Oxford lends sweetness to
labour and dignity to leisure. When I say Oxford
I mean Cambridge, for a stray savage is not the least
obliged to know the difference, and it suddenly
strikes me as being both very pedantic and very
good-natured in him to pretend to know it. What
institution is more majestic than Trinity College?
what can affect more a stray savage than the
hospitality of such an institution? The first quadrangle
is of immense extent, and the buildings that
surround it, with their long, rich fronts of time-deepened
grey, are the stateliest in the world. In the
centre of the court are two or three acres of close-shaven
lawn, out of the midst of which rises a grand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262" name="Page_262" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_262">262</a></span>
gothic fountain, where the serving-men fill up their
buckets. There are towers and battlements and
statues, and besides these things there are cloisters
and gardens and bridges. There are charming
rooms in a kind of stately gate-tower, and the rooms,
occupying the thickness of the building, have windows
looking out on one side over the magnificent
quadrangle, with half a mile or so of Decorated
architecture, and on the other into deep-bosomed
trees. And in the rooms is the best company conceivable—distinguished
men who are thoroughly
conversible, intimately affable. I spent a beautiful
Sunday morning walking about the place with one
of these gentlemen and attempting to <i>débrouiller</i>
its charms. These are a very complicated tangle,
and I do not pretend, in memory, to keep the colleges
apart. There are none the less half a dozen
points that make ineffaceable pictures. Six or
eight of the colleges stand in a row, turning their
backs to the river; and hereupon ensues the loveliest
confusion of gothic windows and ancient trees,
of grassy banks and mossy balustrades, of sun-chequered
avenues and groves, of lawns and gardens
and terraces, of single-arched bridges spanning the
little stream, which is small and shallow and looks
as if it had been turned on for ornamental purposes.
The thin-flowing Cam appears to exist simply as
an occasion for these brave little bridges—the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263" name="Page_263" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_263">263</a></span>
beautiful covered gallery of John’s or the slightly
collapsing arch of Clare. In the way of college-courts
and quiet scholastic porticoes, of grey-walled
gardens and ivied nooks of study, in all the pictorial
accidents of a great English university, Cambridge
is delightfully and inexhaustibly rich. I looked at
these one by one and said to myself always that
the last was the best. If I were called upon, however,
to mention the prettiest corner of the world,
I should draw out a thoughtful sigh and point the
way to the garden of Trinity Hall. My companion,
who was very competent to judge (but who spoke
indeed with the partiality of a son of the house),
declared, as he ushered me into it, that it was, to his
mind, the most beautiful <i>small</i> garden in Europe.
I freely accepted, and I promptly repeat, an affirmation
so magnanimously conditioned. The little
garden at Trinity Hall is narrow and crooked; it
leans upon the river, from which a low parapet, all
muffled in ivy, divides it; it has an ancient wall
adorned with a thousand matted creepers on one
side, and on the other a group of extraordinary
horse-chestnuts. The trees are of prodigious size;
they occupy half the garden, and are remarkable
for the fact that their giant limbs strike down into
the earth, take root again and emulate, as they rise,
the majesty of the parent stem. The manner in
which this magnificent group of horse-chestnuts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264" name="Page_264" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_264">264</a></span>
sprawls about over the grass, out into the middle of
the lawn, is one of the most heart-shaking features
of the garden of Trinity Hall. Of course the single
object at Cambridge that makes the most abiding
impression is the famous chapel of King’s College—the
most beautiful chapel in England. The effect
it attempts to produce within is all in the sphere of
the sublime. The attempt succeeds, and the success
is attained by a design so light and elegant that at
first it almost defeats itself. The sublime usually
has more of a frown and straddle, and it is not until
after you have looked about you for ten minutes
that you perceive the chapel to be saved from being
the prettiest church in England by the accident of
its being one of the noblest. It is a cathedral without
aisles or columns or transepts, but (as a compensation)
with such a beautiful slimness of clustered
tracery soaring along the walls and spreading,
bending, and commingling in the roof, that its
simplicity seems only a richness the more. I stood
there for a quarter of an hour on a Sunday morning;
there was no service, but in the choir behind
the great screen which divides the chapel in half
the young choristers were rehearsing for the afternoon.
The beautiful boy voices rose together and
touched the splendid vault; they hung there, expanding
and resounding, and then, like a rocket
that spends itself, they faded and melted toward
the end of the building. It was positively a choir
of angels.

Cambridgeshire is one of the so-called ugly counties;
which means that it is observably flat. It is
for this reason that the absence of terrestrial accent
which culminates at Newmarket constitutes so perfect
a means to an end. The country is like a board
of green cloth; the turf presents itself as a friendly
provision of nature. Nature offers her gentle bosom
as a gaming-table; card-tables, billiard-tables are
but a humble imitation of Newmarket Heath. It
was odd to think that amid so much of the appearance
of the humility of real virtue, there is more
profane betting than anywhere else in the world.
The large, neat English meadows roll away to
a humid-looking sky, the young partridges jump
about in the hedges, and nature looks not in the least
as if she were offering you odds. The gentlemen
look it, though, the gentlemen whom you meet on
the roads and in the railway carriage; they have
that marked air—it pervades a man from the cut
of his whisker to the shape of his boot-toe—as of
the sublimated stable. It is brought home to you
that to an immense number of people in England the
events in the “Racing Calendar” constitute the
most important portion of contemporary history.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266" name="Page_266" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_266">266</a></span>
The very breeze has an equine snort, if it doesn’t
breathe as hard as a hostler; the blue and white of
the sky, dappled and spotty, recalls the figure of the
necktie of “spring meetings;” and the landscape is
coloured as a sporting-print is coloured—with the
same gloss, the same that seems to say a thousand
grooms have rubbed it down.
</p>

<p>
The destruction of partridges is, if an equally
classical, a less licentious pursuit, for which, I
believe, Cambridgeshire offers peculiar facilities.
Among these is a particular shooting-box which is
a triumph of the familiar, the accidental style and
a temple of clear hospitality. The shooting belongs
to the autumn, not to this vernal period; but as
I have spoken of echoes I suppose that if I had
listened attentively I might have heard the ghostly
crack of some of the famous shots that have been
discharged there. The air, notedly, had vibrated
to several august rifles, but all that I happened to
hear by listening was some excellent talk. In England,
at any rate, as I said just now, a couple of
places may be very near together and yet have what
the philosophers call a connotation strangely different.
Only a few miles beyond Newmarket lies Bury
St. Edmunds, a town whose tranquil antiquity turns
its broad grey back straight upon the sporting
papers. I confess that I went to Bury simply on the
strength of its name, which I had often encountered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267" name="Page_267" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_267">267</a></span>
and which had always seemed to me to have a high
value for the picture-seeker. I knew that St. Edmund
had been an Anglo-Saxon worthy, but my
conviction that the little town that bore his name
would move me to rapture between trains had nothing
definite to rest upon. The event, however,
rewarded my faith—rewarded it with the sight of a
magnificent old gate-house of the thirteenth century,
the most substantial of many relics of the great
abbey which once flourished there. There are many
others; they are scattered about the old precinct of
the abbey, a large portion of which has been converted
into a rambling botanic garden, the resort at
Whitsuntide of a thousand very modern merry-makers.
The monument I speak of has the proportions
of a triumphal arch; it is at once a gateway
and a fortress; it is covered with beautiful ornament
and is altogether the lion of Bury.

<h2>
AN ENGLISH NEW YEAR
</h2>

<p>
It will hardly be pretended this year that the
English Christmas has been a merry one, or that
the New Year has the promise of being particularly
happy. The winter is proving very cold and vicious—as
if nature herself were loath to be left out of
the general conspiracy against the comfort and self-complacency
of man. The country at large has a
sense of embarrassment and depression, which is
brought home more or less to every class in the
closely graduated social hierarchy, and the light of
Christmas firesides has by no means dispelled the
gloom. Not that I mean to overstate the gloom. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270" name="Page_270" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_270">270</a></span>
is difficult to imagine any combination of adverse
circumstances powerful enough to infringe very sensibly
upon the appearance of activity and prosperity,
social stability and luxury, which English life must
always present to a stranger. Nevertheless the times
are distinctly of the kind synthetically spoken of as
hard—there is plenty of evidence of it—and the
spirits of the public are not high. The depression of
business is extreme and universal; I am ignorant
whether it has reached so calamitous a point as that
almost hopeless prostration of every industry which
it is assured us you have lately witnessed in America,
and I believe the sound of lamentation is by no
means so loud as it has been on two or three occasions
within the present century. The possibility of
distress among the lower classes has been minimised
by the gigantic poor-relief system which is so characteristic
a feature of English civilisation and which,
under especial stress, is supplemented (as is the case
at present) by private charity proportionately huge.
I notice too that in some parts of the country discriminating
groups of work-people have selected
these dismal days as a happy time for striking.
When the labouring classes rise to the recreation of a
strike I suppose the situation may be said to have its
cheerful side. There is, however, great distress in
the North, and there is a general feeling of scant
money to play with throughout the country. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271" name="Page_271" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_271">271</a></span>
“Daily News” has sent a correspondent to the great
industrial regions, and almost every morning for the
last three weeks a very cleverly executed picture of
the misery of certain parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire
has been served up with the matutinal tea and
toast. The work is a good one, and, I take it, eminently
worth doing, as it appears to have had a
visible effect upon the purse-strings of the well-to-do.
There is nothing more striking in England than the
success with which an “appeal” is always made.
Whatever the season or whatever the cause, there
always appears to be enough money and enough
benevolence in the country to respond to it in sufficient
measure—a remarkable fact when one remembers
that there is never a moment of the year when
the custom of “appealing” intermits. Equally striking
perhaps is the perfection to which the science
of distributing charity has been raised—the way it
has been analysed and organised and made one of
the exact sciences. You perceive that it has occupied
for a long time a foremost place among administrative
questions, and has received all the light that
experience and practice can throw upon it. Is there
in this perception more of a lightened or more of an
added weight for the brooding consciousness? Truly
there are aspects of England at which one can but
darkly stare.

<p>
I left town a short time before Christmas and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272" name="Page_272" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_272">272</a></span>
went to spend the festive season in the North, in a
part of the country with which I was unacquainted.
It was quite possible to absent one’s self from London
without a sense of sacrifice, for the charms of
the capital during the last several weeks have been
obscured by peculiarly vile weather. It is of course
a very old story that London is foggy, and this simple
statement raises no blush on the face of nature as
we see it here. But there are fogs and fogs, and the
folds of the black mantle have been during the
present winter intolerably thick. The thickness that
draws down and absorbs the smoke of the housetops,
causes it to hang about the streets in impenetrable
density, forces it into one’s eyes and down one’s
throat, so that one is half-blinded and quite sickened—this
form of the particular plague has been much
more frequent than usual. Just before Christmas,
too, there was a heavy snow-storm, and even a tolerably
light fall of snow has London quite at its mercy.
The emblem of purity is almost immediately converted
into a sticky, lead-coloured mush, the cabs
skulk out of sight or take up their stations before the
lurid windows of a public-house, which glares
through the sleety darkness at the desperate wayfarer
with an air of vulgar bravado. For recovery of
one’s nervous balance the only course was flight—flight
to the country and the confinement of one’s
vision to the large area of one of those admirable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273" name="Page_273" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_273">273</a></span>
homes which at this season overflow with hospitality
and good cheer. By this means the readjustment is
effectually brought about—these are conditions
that you cordially appreciate. Of all the great things
that the English have invented and made a part of
the credit of the national character, the most perfect,
the most characteristic, the one they have mastered
most completely in all its details, so that it has become
a compendious illustration of their social
genius and their manners, is the well-appointed,
well-administered, well-filled country-house. The
grateful stranger makes these reflections—and
others besides—as he wanders about in the beautiful
library of such a dwelling, of an inclement winter
afternoon, just at the hour when six o’clock tea is
impending. Such a place and such a time abound in
agreeable episodes; but I suspect that the episode
from which, a fortnight ago, I received the most
ineffaceable impression was but indirectly connected
with the charms of a luxurious fireside. The country
I speak of was a populous manufacturing region,
full of tall chimneys and of an air that is grey and
gritty. A lady had made a present of a Christmas-tree
to the children of a workhouse, and she invited
me to go with her and assist at the distribution of the
toys. There was a drive through the early dusk of a
very cold Christmas Eve, followed by the drawing up
of a lamp-lit brougham in the snowy quadrangle of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274" name="Page_274" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_274">274</a></span>
a grim-looking charitable institution. I had never
been in an English workhouse before, and this one
transported me, with the aid of memory, to the early
pages of “Oliver Twist.” We passed through cold,
bleak passages, to which an odour of suet-pudding,
the aroma of Christmas cheer, failed to impart an
air of hospitality; and then, after waiting a while
in a little parlour appertaining to the superintendent,
where the remainder of a dinner of by no means
eleemosynary simplicity and the attitude of a gentleman
asleep with a flushed face on the sofa seemed
to effect a tacit exchange of references, we were
ushered into a large frigid refectory, chiefly illumined
by the twinkling tapers of the Christmas-tree. Here
entered to us some hundred and fifty little children
of charity, who had been making a copious dinner
and who brought with them an atmosphere of hunger
memorably satisfied—together with other
traces of the occasion upon their pinafores and their
small red faces. I have said that the place reminded
me of “Oliver Twist,” and I glanced through this
little herd for an infant figure that should look as if it
were cut out for romantic adventures. But they
were all very prosaic little mortals. They were made
of very common clay indeed, and a certain number
of them were idiotic. They filed up and received
their little offerings, and then they compressed themselves
into a tight infantine bunch and, lifting up
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275" name="Page_275" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_275">275</a></span>
their small hoarse voices, directed a melancholy
hymn toward their benefactress. The scene was a
picture I shall not forget, with its curious mixture
of poetry and sordid prose—the dying wintry light
in the big, bare, stale room; the beautiful Lady
Bountiful, standing in the twinkling glory of the
Christmas-tree; the little multitude of staring and
wondering, yet perfectly expressionless, faces.

<h2>
AN ENGLISH WINTER WATERING-PLACE
</h2>

<p>
I have just been spending a couple of days at a
well-known resort upon the Kentish coast, and
though such an exploit is by no means unprecedented,
yet, as to the truly observing mind no opportunity
is altogether void and no impressions are
wholly valueless, I have it on my conscience to make
a note of my excursion. Superficially speaking, it
was wanting in originality; but I am afraid that it
afforded me as much entertainment as if the idea
of paying a visit to Hastings had been an invention
of my own. This is so far from being the case that
the most striking feature of the town in question is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278" name="Page_278" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_278">278</a></span>
the immense provision made there for the entertainment
of visitors. Hastings and St. Leonards, standing
side by side, present a united sea-front of more
miles in length than I shall venture to compute.
It is sufficient that in going from one end of the place
to the other I had a greater sense of having taken a
long, straight walk through street scenery than I had
done since I last measured the populated length of
Broadway. This is not an image that evokes any
one of the graces, and it must be confessed that the
beauty of Hastings does not reside in a soft irregularity
or a rural exuberance. Like all the larger
English watering-places it is simply a little London
<i>super mare</i>. The graceful, or at least the pictorial, is
always to be found in England if one will take the
trouble of looking for it; but it must be conceded
that at Hastings this element is less obtrusive than
it might be. I had heard it described as a “dull
Brighton,” and this description had been intended
to dispose of the place. In fact, however, such is
the perversity of the enquiring mind, it had rather
quickened than quenched my interest. It occurred
to me that it might be as entertaining to follow out
the variations of Brighton, the possible embroideries
of the theme, as it is often found to listen to those
with which some expressed musical idea is overscored
by another composer. Four or five miles of
lodging-houses and hotels staring at the sea across
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279" name="Page_279" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_279">279</a></span>
a “parade” adorned with iron benches, with hand-organs
and German bands, with nursemaids and
British babies, with ladies and gentlemen of leisure—looking
rather embarrassed with it and trying
rather unsuccessfully to get rid of it—this is the great
feature which Brighton and Hastings have in common.
At Brighton there is a certain variety and
gaiety of colour—something suggesting crookedness
and yellow paint—which gives the scene a kind of
cheerful, easy, more or less vulgar, foreign air. But
Hastings is very grey and sober and English, and
indeed it is because it seemed to me so English that
I gave my best attention to it. If one is attempting
to gather impressions of a people and to learn to
know them, everything is interesting that is characteristic,
quite apart from its being beautiful. English
manners are made up of such a multitude of
small details that the portrait a stranger has privately
sketched in is always liable to receive new
touches. And this indeed is the explanation of his
noting a great many small points, on the spot, with
a degree of relish and appreciation which must often,
to persons who are not in his position, appear exaggerated,
if not absurd. He has formed a mental picture
of the civilisation of the people he lives among,
and whom, when he has a great deal of courage, he
makes bold to say he is studying; he has drawn up
a kind of tabular view of their manners and customs,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280" name="Page_280" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_280">280</a></span>
their idiosyncrasies, their social institutions, their
general features and properties; and when once he
has suspended this rough cartoon in the chambers
of his imagination he finds a great deal of occupation
in touching it up and filling it in. Wherever he
goes, whatever he sees, he adds a few strokes. That
is how I spent my time at Hastings.

I found it, for instance, a question more interesting
than it might superficially appear to choose
between the inns—between the Royal Hotel upon
the Parade and an ancient hostel, a survival of the
posting-days, in a side street. A friend had described
the latter establishment to me as “mellow,” and
this epithet complicated the problem. The term
mellow, as applied to an inn, is the comparative
degree of a state of things of which (say) “musty”
would be the superlative. If you can seize this
tendency in its comparative stage you may do very
well indeed; the trouble is that, like all tendencies,
it contains, even in its earlier phases, the germs of
excess. I thought it very possible that the Swan
would be over-ripe; but I thought it equally probable
that the Royal would be crude. I could claim
a certain acquaintance with “royal” hotels—I
knew just how they were constituted. I foresaw the
superior young woman sitting at a ledger, in a kind
of glass cage, at the bottom of the stairs, and expressing
by refined intonations her contempt for a gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281" name="Page_281" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_281">281</a></span>
who should decline to “require” a sitting-room.
The functionary whom in America we know
and dread as an hotel-clerk belongs in England to
the sex which, at need, is able to look over your head
to a still further point. Large hotels here are almost
always owned and carried on by companies, and the
company is represented by a well-shaped female
figure belonging to the class whose members are
more particularly known as “persons.” The chambermaid
is a young woman, and the female tourist is
a lady; but the occupant of the glass cage, who
hands you your key and assigns you your apartment,
is designated in the manner I have mentioned.
The “person” has various methods of revenging
herself for her shadowy position in the social scale,
and I think it was from a vague recollection of having
on former occasions felt the weight of her embittered
spirit that I determined to seek the hospitality
of the humbler inn, where it was probable that one
who was himself humble would enjoy a certain consideration.
In the event, I was rather oppressed by
the feather-bed quality of the welcome extended to
me at the Swan. Once established there, in a sitting-room
(after all), the whole affair had all the local
colour I could desire.
</p>

<p>
I have sometimes had occasion to repine at the
meagreness and mustiness of the old-fashioned English
inn, and to feel that in poetry and in fiction
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282" name="Page_282" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_282">282</a></span>
these defects had been culpably glossed over. But
I said to myself the other evening that there is a
kind of venerable decency even in some of its dingiest
consistencies, and that in an age in which the
conception of good manners is losing most of its
ancient firmness one should do justice to an institution
that is still more or less of a stronghold of the
faded amenities. It is a satisfaction in moving about
the world to be treated as a gentleman, and this
gratification appears to be more than, in the light of
modern science, a Company can profitably undertake
to bestow. I have an old friend, a person of
admirably conservative instincts, from whom, a
short time since, I borrowed a hint of this kind. This
lady had been staying at a small inn in the country
with her daughter; the daughter, whom we shall
call Mrs. B., had left the house a few days before the
mother. “Did you like the place?” I asked of my
friend; “was it comfortable?” “No, it was not
comfortable; but I liked it. It was shabby, and I
was much overcharged; but it pleased me.” “What
was the mysterious charm?” “Well, when I was
coming away, the landlady—she had cheated me
horribly—came to my carriage, and dropped a
curtsy, and said, ‘My duty to Mrs. B., ma’am.’ Que
voulez-vous? That pleased me.” There was an
old waiter at Hastings who would have been capable
of that—an old waiter who had been in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283" name="Page_283" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_283">283</a></span>
house for forty years and who was not so much an
individual waiter as the very spirit and genius, the
incarnation and tradition of waiterhood. He was
faded and weary and rheumatic, but he had a sort
of mixture of the paternal and the deferential, the
philosophic and the punctilious, which seemed but
grossly requited by a present of a small coin. I am
not fond of jugged hare for dinner, either as a light
<i>entrée</i> or as a <i>pièce de résistance</i>; but this accomplished
attendant had the art of presenting you such
a dish in a manner that persuaded you, for the time,
that it was worthy of your serious consideration.
The hare, by the way, before being subjected to the
mysterious operation of jugging, might have been
seen dangling from a hook in the bar of the inn,
together with a choice collection of other viands.
You might peruse the bill of fare in an elementary
form as you passed in and out of the house, and
make up your <i>menu</i> for the day by poking with your
stick at a juicy-looking steak or a promising fowl.
The landlord and his spouse were always on the
threshold of the bar, polishing a brass candlestick
and paying you their respects; the place was pervaded
by an aroma of rum-and-water and of commercial
travellers’ jokes.
</p>

<p>
This description, however, is lacking in the element
of gentility, and I will not pursue it farther, for
I should give a very false impression of Hastings
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284" name="Page_284" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_284">284</a></span>
if I were to omit so characteristic a feature. It was,
I think, the element of gentility that most impressed
me. I know that the word I have just ventured
to use is under the ban of contemporary taste; so
I may as well say outright that I regard it as indispensable
in almost any attempt at portraiture of
English manners. It is vain for an observer of such
things to pretend to get on without it. One may talk
of foreign life indefinitely—of the manners and
customs of France, Germany, and Italy—and
never feel the need of this suggestive, yet mysteriously
discredited, epithet. One may survey the
remarkable face of American civilisation without
finding occasion to strike this particular note. But
in England no circumlocution will serve—the note
must be definitely struck. To attempt to speak of
an English watering-place in winter and yet pass it
over in silence would be to forfeit all claims to the
analytic spirit. For a stranger, at any rate, the term
is invaluable—it is more convenient than I should
find easy to say. It is instantly evoked in my mind
by long rows of smuttily-plastered houses, with a
card inscribed “Apartments” suspended in the
window of the ground-floor sitting-room—that portion
of the dwelling which is known in lodging-house
parlance as “the parlours.” Everything, indeed,
suggests it—the bath-chairs, drawn up for hire in
a melancholy row; the innumerable and excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285" name="Page_285" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_285">285</a></span>
shops, adorned with the latest photographs of the
royal family and of Mrs. Langtry; the little reading-room
and circulating library on the Parade, where
the daily papers, neatly arranged, may be perused
for a trifling fee, and the novels of the season are
stacked away like the honeycombs in an apiary;
the long pier, stretching out into the sea, to which
you are admitted by the payment of a penny at a
wicket, and where you may enjoy the music of an
indefatigable band, the enticements of several little
stalls for the sale of fancy-work, and the personal
presence of good local society. It is only the winking,
twinkling, easily-rippling sea that is not genteel.
But, really, I was disposed to say at Hastings that if
the sea was not genteel, so much the worse for Neptune;
for it was the favourable aspect of the great
British proprieties and solemnities that struck me.
Hastings and St. Leonards, with their long, warm
sea-front and their multitude of small, cheap comforts
and conveniences, offer a kind of résumé of
middle-class English civilisation and of advantages
of which it would ill become an American to make
light. I don’t suppose that life at Hastings is the
most exciting or the most gratifying in the world, but
it must certainly have its advantages. If I were a
quiet old lady of modest income and nice habits—or
even a quiet old gentleman of the same pattern—I
should certainly go to Hastings. There, amid the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286" name="Page_286" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_286">286</a></span>
little shops and the little libraries, the bath-chairs
and the German bands, the Parade and the long
Pier, with a mild climate, a moderate scale of prices
and the consciousness of a high civilisation, I should
enjoy a seclusion which would have nothing primitive
or crude.

<h2>
WINCHELSEA, RYE, AND “DENIS DUVAL”
</h2>

<h3 class="lowpad">
I
</h3>

<p>
I have recently had a literary adventure which,
though not followed by the prostration that
sometimes ensues on adventures, has nevertheless
induced meditation. The adventure itself indeed
was not astounding, and I mention it, to be frank,
only in the interest of its sequel. It consisted merely,
on taking up an old book again for the sake of a
certain desired and particular light, of my having
found that the light was in fact not there to shine,
but was, on the contrary, directly projected <i>upon</i> the
book from the very subject itself as to which I had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288" name="Page_288" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_288">288</a></span>
invoked assistance. The case, in short, to put it
simply, was that Thackeray’s charming fragment
of “Denis Duval” proved to have much less than
I had supposed to say about the two little old towns
with which the few chapters left to us are mainly
concerned, but that the two little old towns, on the
other hand, unexpectedly quickened reflection on
“Denis Duval.” Reading over Thackeray to help
me further to Winchelsea, I became conscious, of a
sudden, that Winchelsea—which I already in a
manner knew—was only helping me further to
Thackeray. Reinforced, in this service, by its little
sister-city of Rye, it caused a whole question to open,
and the question, in turn, added a savour to a sense
already, by good fortune, sharp. Winchelsea and
Rye form together a very curious small corner,
and the measure, candidly undertaken, of what the
unfinished book had done with them, brought me
to a nearer view of them—perhaps even to a more
jealous one; as well as to some consideration of
what books in general, even when finished, may do
with curious small corners.
</p>

<p>
I daresay I speak of “Denis Duval” as “old”
mainly to make an impression on readers whose age
is less. I remember, after all, perfectly, the poetry
of its original appearance—there was such a thrill,
in those days, even after “Lovel the Widower” and
“Philip,” at any new Thackeray—in the cherished
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289" name="Page_289" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_289">289</a></span>
“Cornhill” of the early time, with a drawing of
Frederick Walker to its every number and a possibility
of its being like “Esmond” in its embroidered
breast. If, moreover, it after a few months broke
short off, that really gave it something as well as
took something away. It might have been as true
of works of art as of men and women, that if the
gods loved them they died young. “Denis Duval”
was at any rate beautiful, and was beautiful again on
reperusal at a later time. It is all beautiful once
more to a final reading, only it is remarkably different:
and this is precisely where my story lies. The
beauty is particularly the beauty of its being its
author’s—which is very much, with book after
book, what we find ourselves coming to in general,
I think, at fifty years. Our appreciation changes—how
in the world, with experience always battering
away, shouldn’t it?—but our feeling, more
happily, doesn’t. There <i>are</i> books, of course, that
criticism, when we are fit for it, only consecrates, and
then, with association fiddling for the dance, we are
in possession of a literary pleasure that is the highest
of raptures. But in many a case we drag along a
fond indifference, an element of condonation, which
is by no means of necessity without its strain of
esteem, but which, obviously, is not founded on one
of our deeper satisfactions. Each can but speak, at
all events, on such a matter, for himself. It is a matter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290" name="Page_290" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_290">290</a></span>
also, doubtless, that belongs to the age of the
loss—so far as they quite depart—of illusions at
large. The reason for liking a particular book becomes
thus a better, or at least a more generous, one
than the particular book seems in a position itself
at last to supply. Woe to the mere official critic, the
critic who has never felt the <i>man</i>. You go on liking
“The Antiquary” because it is Scott. You go on
liking “David Copperfield”—I don’t say you go
on reading it, which is a very different matter—because
it is Dickens. So you go on liking “Denis
Duval” because it is Thackeray—which, in this
last case, is the logic of the charm I alluded to.

<p>
The recital here, as every one remembers, is
autobiographic; the old battered, but considerably
enriched, world-worn, but finely sharpened Denis
looks back upon a troubled life from the winter fireside
and places you, in his talkative and contagious
way,—he is a practised literary artist,—in possession
of the story. We see him in a placid port after
many voyages, and have that amount of evidence—the
most, after all, that the most artless reader
needs—as to the “happy” side of the business.
The evidence indeed is, for curiosity, almost excessive,
or at least premature; as he again and again
puts it before us that the companion of his later
time, the admirable wife seated there beside him,
is nobody else at all, any hopes of a more tangled
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291" name="Page_291" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_291">291</a></span>
skein notwithstanding, than the object of his infant
passion, the little French orphan, slightly younger
than himself, who is brought so promptly on the
scene. The way in which this affects us as undermining
the “love-interest” bears remarkably on
the specific question of the subject of the book as
the author would have expressed this subject to his
own mind. We get, to the moment the work drops,
not a glimpse of his central idea; nothing, if such
had been his intention, was in fact ever more triumphantly
concealed. The darkness therefore is
intensified by our seeming to gather that, like the
love-interest, at all events, the “female interest”
was not to have been largely invoked. The narrator
is in general, from the first, full of friendly hints,
in Thackeray’s way, of what is to come; but the
chapters completed deal only with his childish years,
his wondrous boy-life at Winchelsea and Rye, the
public and private conditions of which—practically,
in the last century, the same for the two places—form
the background for this exposition. The southeastern
counties, comparatively at hand, were enriched
at that period by a considerable French immigration,
the accession of Huguenot fugitives too
firm in their faith to have bent their necks to the
dire rigours with which the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes was followed up. This corner of Sussex
received—as it had received in previous centuries—its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292" name="Page_292" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_292">292</a></span>
forlorn contingent; to the interesting origin
of which many Sussex family names—losing, as it
were, their drawing but not their colour—still sufficiently
testify. Portions of the stranger race suffered,
struggled, sank; other portions resisted, took root
and put forth branches, and Thackeray, clearly,
had found his rough material in some sketchy vision
of one of these obscure cases of troubled adjustment,
which must often have been, for difficulty and complexity,
of the stuff of dramas. Such a case, for the
informed fancy, might indeed overflow with possibilities
of character, character reinforced, in especial,
by the impression, gathered and matured on the
spot, of the two small ghosts of the Cinque Ports
family, the pair of blighted hill-towns that were once
sea-towns and that now draw out their days in the
dim after-sense of a mere indulged and encouraged
picturesqueness. “Denis Duval” could only, it
would seem, have been conceived as a “picturesque”
affair; but that may serve exactly as a reason for the
attempt to refigure it.
</p>

<p>
Little hilltop communities sensibly even yet, with
the memory of their tight walls and stiff gates not
wholly extinct, Rye and Winchelsea hold fast to the
faint identity which remains their least fragile support,
their estate as “Antient Towns” involved
(with the distincter Five and raising the number to
seven), in that nominal, though still occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293" name="Page_293" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_293">293</a></span>
pompous Wardenship, the image—for our time—of
the most famous assignment of which is preserved
in Longfellow’s fine verses on the death of the Duke
of Wellington. The sea, in previous times half
friend, half foe, began long since to fight, in each
character, shy of them, and now, in wrinkled wistfulness,
they look across at the straight blue band,
two miles or so away, that tells of the services they
rendered, the illusions they cherished,—illusions
in the case of poor Winchelsea especially absurd,—and
the extreme inconvenience they repeatedly
suffered. They were again and again harried and
hacked by the French, and might have had, it would
seem, small appetite for the company, however reduced
and disarmed, of these immemorial neighbours.
The retreating waters, however, had even
two centuries ago already placed such dangers on a
very different footing, and the recovery and evocation
of some of the old processes of actual absorption
may well have presented themselves to Thackeray
as a problem of the sort that tempts the lover of human
histories. Happy and enviable always the first
trepidation of the artist who lights on a setting that
“meets” his subject or on a subject that meets his
setting. The editorial notes to “Denis Duval”
yield unfortunately no indication of whether Winchelsea
put into his head the idea of this study, or of
whether he carried it about till he happened judiciously
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294" name="Page_294" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_294">294</a></span>
to drop it there. Appearances point, in truth,
to a connection of the latter kind, for the fragment
itself contains no positive evidence that Thackeray
ever, with the mere eye of sense, beheld the place;
which is precisely one of the ambiguities that challenge
the critic and an item in the unexpectedness
that I spoke of at the beginning of these remarks.
What—in the light, at least, of later fashions—the
place has to offer the actual observer is the effect
of an object seen, a thing of aspect and suggestion,
situation and colour; but what had it to offer Thackeray—or
the taste of forty years ago—that he so
oddly forbore to give us a tangled clew to? The impression
of to-day’s reader is that the chapters we
possess might really have been written without the
author’s having stood on the spot; and that is just
why they have, as I began by saying, so much less
to contribute to our personal vision than this influence,
for its part, has to suggest in respect to the
book itself.
</p>

<p>
Evidently, none the less, the setting, little as it
has got itself “rendered,” did somehow come into
the painter’s ken; we know this, moreover, independently,
and we make out that he had his inner
mysteries and his reasons. The little house of Duval,
faring forth from the stress of the Alsatian fatherland,
seeks safety and finds business in the shrunken
city, scarce at last more than a hamlet, of Edward
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295" name="Page_295" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_295">295</a></span>
the First’s defeated design, where, in three generations,
well on into the century, it grinds and sleeps,
smuggles and spends, according to the fashions of
the place and time. These communities appear to
have had, in their long decline, little industry but
their clandestine traffic with other coasts, in the
course of which they quite mastered the art of going,
as we say, “one better” than the officers of the
revenue. It is to this hour a part of the small romance
of Rye that you may fondly fancy such scant
opulence as rears its head to have had its roots in
the malpractice of forefathers not too rude for much
cunning—in nightly plots and snares and flurries,
a hurrying, shuffling, hiding, that might at any time
have put a noose about most necks. Some of those
of the small gentry who were not smugglers were
recorded highwaymen, flourishing about in masks
and with pistols; and indeed in the general scene,
as rendered by the supposed chronicler, these appear
the principal features. The only others are those of
his personal and private situation, which in fact,
however, strikes me as best expressed in the fact that
the extremely talkative, discursive, ejaculatory, and
moralising Denis was possessed in perfection of his
master’s maturest style. He writes, almost to the
life, the language of the “Roundabout Papers;”
so that if the third person had been exchanged,
throughout, for his first, and his occasional present
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296" name="Page_296" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_296">296</a></span>
tense been superseded by the past, the rest of the
text would have needed little rearrangement. This
imperfect unity was more or less inevitable—the
difficulty of projecting yourself as somebody else is
never so great as when you retain the <i>form</i> of being
yourself; but another of the many reflections suggested
by reperusal is as to whether the speaker is
not guilty of a slight abuse. Of course it may be said
that what really has happened was that Thackeray
had, on his side, anticipated his hero in the use of
his hero’s natural idiom. It may thus have been
less that Denis had come to write highly “evolved”
nineteenth-century English than that his creator
had arrived, in the “Roundabout Papers” and
elsewhere, at writing excellent reconstructed eighteenth.
It would not, however, were the enquiry to
be pushed, be only on the autobiographer’s personal
and grammatical, but on his moral and sentimental
accent, as it were, that criticism would probably
most bear. His manner of thinking and feeling is
quite as “Roundabout” as his manner of saying.

A dozen wonderments rise here, and a dozen
curiosities and speculations; as to which, in truth, I
am painfully divided between the attraction of such
appeals and a certain other aspect of my subject to
which I shall attempt presently to do justice. The
superior stroke, I remind myself—possibly not in
vain—would be to deal handsomely with both
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297" name="Page_297" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_297">297</a></span>
solicitations. The almost irresistible fascination,
critically speaking, of the questions thus abruptly,
after long years, thrust forth by the book, lies in
their having reference to this very opposition of
times and tastes. The thing is not forty years old,
but it points already—and that is above all the
amusement of it—to a general <i>poetic</i> that, both on
its positive and its negative sides, we have left well
behind. Can the author perhaps have had in mind,
misguidedly, some idea of what his public “wanted”
or didn’t want? The public is really, to a straight
vision, I think, not a capacity for wanting, at all,
but only an unlimited capacity for <i>taking</i>—taking
that (whatever it is) which will, in effect, make it
open its mouth. It goes to the expense of few preconceptions,
and even on the question of opening its
mouth has a consciousness limited to the suspicion
that in a given case this orifice <i>has</i>—or has not—gaped.
We are therefore to imagine Thackeray as
perfectly conscious that he himself, working by his
own fine light, constituted the public he had most
to reckon with. On the other hand his time, in its
degree, had helped to shape him, and a part of the
consequence of this shaping, apparently, was his
extraordinary avoidance of picture. This is the
mystery that drives us to the hypothesis of his
having tried to pay, in some uncanny quarter, some
deluded deference. Was he under the fear that,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298" name="Page_298" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_298">298</a></span>
even as <i>he</i> could do it, “description” would not, in
the early sixties, be welcome? It is impossible to
stand to-day in the high, loose, sunny, haunted
square of Winchelsea without wondering what he
could have been thinking of. There are ladies in
view with easels, sun-bonnets and white umbrellas—often
perceptibly, too, with nothing else that
makes for successful representation; but I doubt
if it were these apparitions that took the bloom from
his vision, for they were much less frequent in those
looser days, and moreover would have formed much
more a reason for not touching the place at all than
for taking it up indifferently. Of any impulse to
make the reader see it with seeing eyes his page, at
all events, gives no sign. We must presently look at
it for ourselves, even at the cost, or with the consequence,
of a certain loyal resentment. For Winchelsea
is strange, individual, charming. What
<i>could</i> he—yes—have been thinking of? We are
wound up for saying that he has given his subject
away, until we suddenly remember that, to this
hour, we have never really made out what his subject
was to have been.

series of introductions lately prepared by Mrs. Richmond
Ritchie for a new and, so far as possible,
biographical edition of her father’s works, to the
reminiscences briefly bearing on Denis, and you will
remain in each case equally distant from a clew.
It is the most puzzling thing in the world, but there
<i>is</i> no clew. There are indications, in respect to the
book, from Thackeray’s hand, memoranda on
matters of detail, and there is in especial a highly
curious letter to his publisher; yet the clew that his
own mind must have held never shows the tip of its
tail. The letter to his publisher, in which, according
to the editor of the fragment, he “sketches his plot
for the information of” that gentleman, reads like
a mystification by which the gentleman was to be
temporarily kept quiet. With an air of telling him
a good deal, Thackeray really tells him nothing—nothing,
I mean, by which he himself would have
been committed to (any more than deterred from)
any idea kept up his sleeve. If he were holding this
card back, to be played at his own time, he could
not have proceeded in the least differently; and one
can construct to-day, with a free hand, one’s picture
of his private amusement at the success of his diplomacy.
All the while, what <i>was</i> the card? The production
of a novel finds perhaps its nearest analogy
in the ride across country; the competent novelist—that
is, the novelist with the real seat—presses
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300" name="Page_300" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_300">300</a></span>
his subject, in spite of hedges and ditches, as hard
as the keen fox-hunter presses the game that has
been started for his day with the hounds. The fox
is the novelist’s idea, and when he rides straight,
he rides, regardless of danger, in whatever direction
that animal takes. As we lay down “Denis Duval,”
however, we feel not only that we are off the scent,
but that we never really have been, with the author,
on it. The fox has got quite away. For it carries us
no further, surely, to say—as may possibly be objected—that
the author’s subject was to have been
neither more nor less than the adventures of his
hero; inasmuch as, turn the thing as we will, these
“adventures” could at the best have constituted
nothing more than its <i>form</i>. It is an affront to the
memory of a great writer to pretend that they were
to have been arbitrary and unselected, that there
was nothing in his mind to determine them. The
book was, obviously, to have been, as boys say,
“about” them. But what were <i>they</i> to have been
about? Thackeray carried the mystery to his grave.

II
</h3>

<p>
If I spoke just now of Winchelsea as haunted, let
this somewhat overworked word stand as an ineffectual
tribute to the small, sad, civic history that
the place appeals to us to reconstruct as we gaze
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301" name="Page_301" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_301">301</a></span>
vaguely about. I have a little ancient and most
decorative map of Sussex—testifying remarkably
to the changes of relation between sea and land in
this corner of the coast—in which “Old Winchelsey
Drowned” figures as the melancholy indication
of a small circular spot quite out at sea. If new
Winchelsea is old, the earlier town is to-day but the
dim ghost of a tradition, with its very site—distant
several miles from that of its successor—rendered
uncertain by the endless mutation of the shore.
After suffering, all through the thirteenth century,
much stress of wind and weather, it was practically
destroyed in 1287 by a great storm which cast up
masses of beach, altered the course of a river, and
roughly handled the face of many things. The reconstruction
of the town in another place was thereupon
decreed by a great English king, and we need
but a little fuller chronicle to help us to assist at one
of those migrations of a whole city of which antiquity
so often gives us the picture. The survivors of
Winchelsea were colonised, and colonised in much
state. The “new” community, whose life was also
to be so brief, sits on the pleasant table of a great
cliff-like hill which, in the days of the Plantagenets,
was an admirable promontory washed by the waves.
The sea surrounded its base, came up past it to the
east and north in a long inlet, and stretched away,
across the level where the sheep now graze, to stout
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302" name="Page_302" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_302">302</a></span>
little neighbouring Rye, perched—in doubtless not
quite equal pride—on an eminence more humble,
but which must have counted then even for more
than to-day in the pretty figure made, as you stand
off, by the small, compact, pyramidal port. The
“Antient Towns” looked at each other then across
the water, which made almost an island of the rock
of huddled, church-crowned Rye—which had too
much to say to them alike, on evil days, at their best
time, but which was too soon to begin to have too
little. If the early Winchelsea was to suffer by
“drowning,” its successor was to bear the stroke of
remaining high and dry. The haven on the hill-top—a
bold and extraordinary conception—had hardly
had time to get, as we should now say, “started,”
before it began to see its days numbered. The sea
and the shore were never at peace together, and it
was, most remarkably, not the sea that got the best
of it. Winchelsea had only time to dream a great
dream—the dream of a scant pair of centuries—before
its hopes were turned to bitterness and its
boasts to lamentation. It had literally, during its
short career, put in a claim to rivalship with the
port of London. The irony of fate now sits in its
empty lap; but the port of London has never suggested
even a frustrate “Denis Duval.”

<p>
While Winchelsea dreamed, at any rate, she
worked, and the noble fragment of her great church,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303" name="Page_303" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_303">303</a></span>
rising solid from the abortive symmetry of her great
square, helps us to put our hand on her deep good
faith. She built at least as she believed—she planned
as she fondly imagined. The huge ivy-covered choir
and transepts of St. Thomas of Canterbury—to
whom the structure was addressed—represent to
us a great intention. They are not so mighty, but
they are almost as brave, as the wondrous fragment
of Beauvais. Walled and closed on their unfinished
side, they form at present all the church, and, with
its grand lines of arch and window, its beautiful
gothic tombs and general hugeness and height, the
church—mercifully exempt as yet from restoration—is
wonderful for the place. You may at this hour—if
you are given to such emotions—feel a mild
thrill, not be unaware even of the approach of tears,
as you measure the scale on which the building had
been planned and the ground that the nave and
aisles would have covered. You murmur, in the
summer twilight, a soft “Bravo!” across the ages—to
the ears of heaven knows what poor nameless
ghosts. The square—apparently one of many—was
to have been worthy of New York or of Turin;
for the queerest, quaintest, most touching thing of
all is that the reinstated city was to have been laid
out on the most approved modern lines. Nothing is
more interesting—to the mooning, sketching
spectator—than this evidence that the great Edward
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304" name="Page_304" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_304">304</a></span>
had anticipated us all in the convenient chessboard
pattern. It is true—attention has been
called to the fact—that Pompeii had anticipated
<i>him</i>; but I doubt if he knew much about Pompeii.
His abstract avenues and cross-streets straggle
away, through the summer twilight, into mere legend
and mystery. In speaking awhile since of the gates
of these shattered strongholds as “stiff,” I also spoke
of their walls as “tight;” but the scheme of Winchelsea
must have involved, after all, a certain
looseness of cincture. The old vague girdle is lost
to-day in the fields where the sheep browse, in the
parkish acres where the great trees cluster. The
Sussex oak is mighty—it was of the Sussex oak
that, in the old time, the king’s ships were built;
it was, in particular, to her command of this material
that Rye owed the burdensome honour of supplying
vessels, on constant call, to the royal navy. Strange
is this record, in Holloway’s History of that town,
and in presence of the small things of to-day; so
perpetual, under stress, appears to have been the
demand and so free the supply and the service.
</p>

<p>
Rye continued indeed, under her old brown south
cliff, to build big boats till this industry was smitten
by the adoption of iron. That was the last stroke;
though even now you may see things as you stand on
the edge of the cliff: best of all on the open, sunny
terrace of a dear little old garden—a garden brown-walled,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305" name="Page_305" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_305">305</a></span>
red-walled, rose-covered on its other sides,
divided by the width of a quiet street of grass-grown
cobbles from the house of its master, and possessed
of a little old glass-fronted, panelled pavilion which
I hold to be the special spot in the world where
Thackeray might most fitly have figured out his
story. There is not much room in the pavilion, but
there is room for the hard-pressed table and the
tilted chair—there is room for a novelist and his
friends. The panels have a queer paint and a venerable
slant; the small chimney-place is at your
back; the south window is perfect, the privacy
bright and open. How can I tell what old—what
young—visions of visions and memories of images
come back to me under the influence of this quaint
receptacle, into which, by kind permission, I occasionally
peep, and still more under the charm of
the air and the view that, as I just said, you may
enjoy, close at hand, from the small terrace? How
can I tell why I always keep remembering and losing
there the particular passages of some far-away
foolish fiction, absorbed in extreme youth, which
haunt me, yet escape me, like the echo of an old
premonition? I seem to myself to have lain on the
grass somewhere, as a boy, poring over an English
novel of the period, presumably quite bad,—for
they were pretty bad then too,—and losing myself
in the idea of just such another scene as this. But
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306" name="Page_306" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_306">306</a></span>
even could I rediscover the novel, I wouldn’t go
back to it. It couldn’t have been so good as this;
for this—all concrete and doomed and minimised
as it is—is the real thing. The other little gardens,
other little odds and ends of crooked brown wall
and supported terrace and glazed winter sun-trap,
lean over the cliff that still, after centuries, keeps its
rude drop; they have beneath them the river, a tide
that comes and goes, and the mile or more of grudging
desert level, beyond it, which now throws the
sea to the near horizon, where, on summer days,
with a depth of blue and a scattered gleam of sails,
it looks forgiving and resigned. The little old shipyards
at the base of the rock are for the most part
quite empty, with only vague piles of brown timber
and the deposit of generations of chips; yet a fishing-boat
or two are still on the stocks—an “output”
of three or four a year!—and the ring of the hammer
on the wood, a sound, in such places, rare to
the contemporary ear, comes up, through the sunny
stillness, to your meditative perch.
</p>

<p>
The tidal river, on the left, wanders away to Rye
Harbour and its bar, where the black fishing-boats,
half the time at lop-sided rest in the mud, make a
cluster of slanting spears against the sky. When the
river is full we are proud of its wide light and many
curves; when it is empty we call it, for vague reasons,
“rather Dutch;” and empty or full we sketch
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307" name="Page_307" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_307">307</a></span>
it in the fine weather as hard as ever we can. When
I say “we” I mean <i>they</i> do—it is to speak with
hospitality. They mostly wear, as I have hinted,
large sunbonnets, and they crouch on low camp-stools;
they put in, as they would say, a bit of white,
in places often the least likely. Rye is in truth a
rudimentary drawing-lesson, and you quite embrace
the question when you have fairly seized the formula.
Nothing so “quaint” was ever so easy—nothing
so easy was ever so quaint. Much more to be loved
than feared, she has not, alas, a scrap of “style,” and
she may be effectively rendered without the obligation
of subtlety. At favoured seasons there appear
within her precinct sundry slouch-hatted gentlemen
who study her humble charms through a small telescope
formed by their curved fingers and thumb,
and who are not unliable to define themselves as
French artists leading a train of English and American
lady pupils. They distribute their disciples
over the place, at selected points, where the master,
going his round from hour to hour, reminds you of
nothing so much as a busy <i>chef</i> with many saucepans
on the stove and periodically lifting their covers
for a sniff and a stir. There are ancient doorsteps
that are fairly haunted, for their convenience of
view, by the “class,” and where the fond proprietor,
going and coming, has to pick his way among paraphernalia
or to take flying leaps over genius and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308" name="Page_308" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_308">308</a></span>
industry. If Winchelsea is, as I gather, less beset,
it is simply that Winchelsea enjoys the immunity
of her greater distinction. She is full of that and
must be even more difficult than she at first appears.
But I forsook her and her distinction, just now, and
I must return to them; though the right moment
would quite have been as we stood, at Rye, on the
terrace of the little old south-garden, to which she
presents herself, beyond two or three miles of flat
Dutch-looking interval, from the extreme right, her
few red roofs almost lost on her wooded hill and
her general presence masking, for this view, the
headland of Hastings, ten miles, by the coast, westward.

</div>

<p>
It was about her spacious solitude that we had
already begun to stroll; for the purpose, however,
mainly, of measuring the stretch, south and north,
to the two more crumbled of her three old gates.
They are very far gone, each but the ruin of a ruin;
but it is their actual countrified state that speaks of
the circuit—one hundred and fifty acres—they
were supposed to defend. Under one of them you
may pass, much round about, by high-seated villages
and in constant sight of the sea, toward Hastings;
from the other, slightly the less dilapidated, you may
gather, if much so minded, the suggestion of some
illustration or tail-piece in a volume of Italian travel.
The steep white road plunges crookedly down to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309" name="Page_309" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_309">309</a></span>
where the poor arches that once were massive straddle
across it, while a spreading chestnut, beside
them, plays exactly the part desired—prepares
you, that is, for the crack of the whip of the <i>vetturino</i>
trudging up beside his travelling-carriage. With a
bare-legged urchin and a browsing goat the whole
thing would be there. But we turn, at that point,
to mount again and cross the idle square and come
back to the east gate, which is the aspect of Winchelsea
that presents itself most—and in fact quite
admirably—as the front. Yet by what is it that,
at the end of summer afternoons, my sense of an
obliterated history is fed? There is little but the
church really to testify, for the extraordinary groined
vaults and crypts that are part of the actual pride of
the place—treasure-houses of old merchants, foundations
of upper solidities that now are dust—count
for nothing, naturally, in the immediate effect. The
early houses passed away long ago, and the present
ones speak, in broken accents and scant and shabby
signs, but of the last hundred, the last couple of
hundred, years. Everything that ever happened is
gone, and, for that matter, nothing very eminent,
only a dim mediocrity of life, ever did happen. Rye
has Fletcher the dramatist, the Fletcher of Beaumont,
whom it brought to birth; but Winchelsea
has only the last preachment, under a tree still shown,
of John Wesley. The third Edward and the Black
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310" name="Page_310" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_310">310</a></span>
Prince, in 1350, overcame the Spaniards in a stout
sea-fight within sight of the walls; but I am bound
to confess that I do not at all focus that performance,
am unable, in the changed conditions, to “place”
anything so pompous. In the same way I fail to
“visualise,” thank goodness, either of the several
French inroads that left their mark of massacre
and ruin. What I do see, on the other hand, very
comfortably, is the little undistinguished picture
of a nearer antiquity, the antiquity for a glimpse of
which I reopened “Denis Duval.” Where, please,
was the barber’s shop of the family of that hero,
and where the apartments, where the preferred resorts,
the particular scenes of occupation and diversion,
of the dark Chevalier de la Motte? Where did
this subtle son of another civilisation, with whom
Madame de Saverne had eloped from France, <i>en
plein ancien régime</i>, without the occurrence between
them of the least impropriety, spend his time for so
long a period; where had he his little habits and his
numerous indispensable conveniences? What was
the general geography, to express it synthetically,
of the state of life of the orphaned Clarisse, quartered
with a family of which one of the sons, furiously
desirous of the girl, was, at his lost moments, a
highwayman stopping coaches in the dead of night?
Over nothing in the whole fragment does such
vagueness hover as over the domestic situation, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311" name="Page_311" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_311">311</a></span>
her tender years, of the future Madame Denis. Yet
these are just the things I should have liked to
know—the things, above all, I should have liked
most to tell. Into a vision of <i>them</i>, at least, we can
work ourselves; it is exactly the sort of vision into
which Rye and Winchelsea, and all the land about,
full of lurking hints and modest memories, most
throws us back. I should, in truth, have liked to
lock up our novelist in our little pavilion of inspiration,
the gazebo at Rye, not letting him out till he
should quite have satisfied us.
</p>

<p>
Close beside the east gate, so close that one of its
battered towers leans heavily on the little garden,
is a wonderfully perched cottage, of which the mistress
is a very celebrated lady who resorts to the
place in the intervals of an exacting profession—the
scene of her renown, I may go so far as to mention,
is the theatre—for refreshment and rest. The
small grounds of this refuge, supported by the old
town-wall and the steep plunge of the great hill,
have a rare position and view. The narrow garden
stretches away in the manner of a terrace to which
the top of the wall forms a low parapet; and here it
is that, when the summer days are long, the sweet
old soul of all the land seems most to hang in the air.
It is almost a question indeed whether this fine
Winchelsea front, all silver-grey and ivy-green, is
not even better when making a picture itself from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312" name="Page_312" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_312">312</a></span>
below than when giving you one, with much immensity,
from its brow. This picture is always your
great effect, artfully prepared by an absence of prediction,
when you take a friend over from Rye; and
it would appear quite to settle the small discussion—that
may be said to come up among us so often—of
which is the happier abode. The great thing
is that if you live at Rye you have Winchelsea to
show; whereas if you live at Winchelsea you have
nothing but Rye. This latter privilege I should be
sorry to cry down; but nothing can alter the fact
that, to begin with, the pedestal of Winchelsea has
twice the height, by a rough measure, of that of its
neighbour; and we all know the value of an inch at
the end of a nose. Almost directly under the Winchelsea
hill, crossing the little bridge of the Brede,
you pass beyond a screen of trees and take in, at the
top of the ascent, the two round towers and arch,
ivied and mutilated, but still erect, of the old main
gate. The road either way is long and abrupt, so
that people kind to their beasts alight at the foot,
and cyclists careful of their necks alight at the head.
The brooding spectator, moreover, who forms a
class by himself, pauses, infallibly, as he goes, to
admire the way the great trees cluster and compose
on the high slope, always striking, for him, as day
gathers in and the whole thing melts together, a
classic, academic note, the note of Turner and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313" name="Page_313" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_313">313</a></span>
Claude. From the garden of the distinguished cottage,
at any rate, it is a large, melancholy view—a
view that an occasional perverse person whom it
fails to touch finds easy, I admit, to speak of as
dreary; so that those who love it and are well advised
will ever, at the outset, carry the war into the
enemy’s country by announcing it, with glee, as sad.
Just this it must be that nourishes the sense of
obliterated history as to which I a moment ago
wondered. The air is like that of a room through
which something has been carried that you are
aware of without having seen it. There is a vast
deal of level in the prospect, but, though much depends
on the day and still more on the hour, it is,
at the worst, all too delicate to be ugly. The best
hour is that at which the compact little pyramid of
Rye, crowned with its big but stunted church and
quite covered by the westering sun, gives out the
full measure of its old browns that turn to red and
its old reds that turn to purple. These tones of evening
are now pretty much all that Rye has left to
give, but there are truly, sometimes, conditions of
atmosphere in which I have seen the effect as fantastic.
I sigh when I think, however, what it might
have been if, perfectly placed as it is, the church
tower—which in its more perverse moods only
resembles a big central button, a knob on a pincushion—had
had the grace of a few more feet of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314" name="Page_314" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_314">314</a></span>
stature. But that way depression lies, and the humiliation
of those moments at which the brooding
spectator says to himself that both tower and hill
<i>would</i> have been higher if the place had only been
French or Italian. Its whole pleasant little pathos,
in point of fact, is just that it is homely English.
And even with this, after all, the imagination can
play. The wide, ambiguous flat that stretches eastward
from Winchelsea hill, and on the monotone
of whose bosom, seen at sunset from a friendly
eminence that stands nearer, Rye takes the form of
a huge floating boat, its water-line sharp and its
bulk defined from stem to stern—this dim expanse
is the great Romney Marsh, no longer a marsh
to-day, but, at the end of long years, drained and
ordered, a wide pastoral of grazing, with “new”
Romney town, a Port no more,—not the least of the
shrunken Five,—mellowed to mere russet at the
far end, and other obscure charms, revealed best
to the slow cyclist, scattered over its breast: little
old “bits” that are not to be described, yet are
known, with a small thrill, when seen; little lonely
farms, red and grey; little mouse-coloured churches;
little villages that seem made only for long shadows
and summer afternoons. Brookland, Old Romney,
Ivychurch, Dymchurch, Lydd—they have positively
the prettiest names. But the point to be made
is that, comparing small things with great,—which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315" name="Page_315" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_315">315</a></span>
may always be done when the small things are
amiable,—if Rye and its rock and its church are a
miniature Mont-Saint-Michel, so, when the summer
deepens, the shadows fall, and the mounted shepherds
and their dogs pass before you in the grassy
desert, you find in the mild English “marsh” a
recall of the Roman Campagna.

<h2>
OLD SUFFOLK
</h2>

<p>
I am not sure that before entering the county of
Suffolk in the early part of August, I had been
conscious of any personal relation to it save my
share in what we all inevitably feel for a province
enshrining the birthplace of a Copperfield. The
opening lines in David’s history offered in this particular
an easy perch to my young imagination; and
to recall them to-day, though with a memory long
unrefreshed, is to wonder once more at the depth to
which early impressions strike down. This one in
especial indeed has been the privilege of those millions
of readers who owe to Dickens the glow of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318" name="Page_318" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_318">318</a></span>
prime response to the romantic, that first bite of the
apple of knowledge which leaves a taste for ever on
the tongue. The great initiators give such a colour to
mere names that the things they represent have
often, before contact, been a lively part of experience.
It is hard therefore for an undefended victim
of this kind of emotion to measure, when contact
arrives, the quantity of picture already stored up, to
point to the nucleus of the gallery or trace the history
of the acquaintance. It is true that for the divine
plant of sensibility in youth the watering need never
have been lavish. It flowered, at all events, at the
right moment, in a certain case, into the branching
image of Blunderstone—which, by the way, I am
sorry to see figure as “Blunderston” in gazetteers
of recent date and more than questionable tact.
Dickens took his Rookery exactly where he found it,
and simply fixed it for ever; he left the cradle of the
Copperfields the benefit of its delightful name; or
I should say better, perhaps, left the delightful name
and the obscure nook the benefit of an association
ineffaceable: all of which makes me the more
ashamed not as yet to have found the right afternoon—it
would have in truth to be abnormally long—for
a pious pilgrimage to the distracting little church
where, on David’s sleepy Sundays, one used to lose
one’s self with the sketchy Phiz. One of the reasons
of this omission, so profane on a prior view, is doubtless
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319" name="Page_319" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_319">319</a></span>
that everything, in England, in old-time corners,
has the connecting touch and the quality of illustration,
and that, in a particularly golden August, with
an impression in every bush, the immediate vision,
wherever one meets it, easily attaches and suffices.
Another must have been, I confess, the somewhat
depressed memory of a visit paid a few years since
to the ancient home of the Peggottys, supposedly so
“sympathetic,” but with little left, to-day, as the
event then proved, of the glamour it had worn to the
fancy. Great Yarmouth, it will be remembered, was
a convenient drive from Blunderstone; but Great
Yarmouth, with its mile of cockneyfied sea-front and
its overflow of nigger minstrelsy, now strikes the
wrong note so continuously that I, for my part,
became conscious, on the spot, of a chill to the spirit
of research.
</p>

<p>
This time, therefore, I have allowed that spirit its
ease; and I may perhaps intelligibly make the point
I desire if I contrive to express somehow that I have
found myself, most of the month, none the less
abundantly occupied in reading a fuller sense into
the lingering sound given out, for a candid mind, by
my superscription and watching whatever it may
stand for gradually flush with a stronger infusion.
It takes, in England, for that matter, no wonderful
corner of the land to make the fiddle-string vibrate.
The old usual rural things do this enough, and a part
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320" name="Page_320" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_320">320</a></span>
of the charm of one’s exposure to them is that they
ask one to rise to no heroics. What is the charm,
after all, but just the abyss of the familiar? The
peopled fancy, the haunted memory are themselves
what pay the bill. The game can accordingly be
played with delightful economy, a thrift involving
the cost of little more than a good bicycle. The
bicycle indeed, since I fall back on that admission,
may perhaps, without difficulty, be too good for the
roads. Those of the more devious kind often engender
hereabouts, like the Aristotelian tragedy, pity
and terror; but almost equally with others they lead,
on many a chance, to the ruddiest, greenest hamlets.
What this comes to is saying that I have had, for
many a day, the sweet sense of living, æsthetically,
at really high pressure without, as it were, drawing
on the great fund. By the great fund I mean the
public show, the show for admission to which you
are charged and overcharged, made to taste of the
tree of possible disappointment. The beauty of old
Suffolk in general, and above all of the desperate
depth of it from which I write, is that these things
whisk you straight out of conceivable relation to
that last danger.
</p>

<p>
I defy any one, at desolate, exquisite Dunwich, to
be disappointed in anything. The minor key is
struck here with a felicity that leaves no sigh to be
breathed, no loss to be suffered; a month of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321" name="Page_321" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_321">321</a></span>
place is a real education to the patient, the inner
vision. The explanation of this is, appreciably, that
the conditions give you to deal with not, in the manner
of some quiet countries, what is meagre and
thin, but what has literally, in a large degree, ceased
to be at all. Dunwich is not even the ghost of its
dead self; almost all you can say of it is that it
consists of the mere letters of its old name. The
coast, up and down, for miles, has been, for more
centuries than I presume to count, gnawed away
by the sea. All the grossness of its positive life is now
at the bottom of the German Ocean, which moves
for ever, like a ruminating beast, an insatiable, indefatigable
lip. Few things are so melancholy—and
so redeemed from mere ugliness by sadness—as this
long, artificial straightness that the monster has
impartially maintained. If at low tide you walk on
the shore, the cliffs, of little height, show you a
defence picked as bare as a bone; and you can say
nothing kinder of the general humility and general
sweetness of the land than that this sawlike action
gives it, for the fancy, an interest, a sort of mystery,
that more than makes up for what it may have surrendered.
It stretched, within historic times, out
into towns and promontories for which there is now
no more to show than the empty eye-holes of a skull;
and half the effect of the whole thing, half the secret
of the impression, and what I may really call, I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322" name="Page_322" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_322">322</a></span>
think, the source of the distinction, is this very
visibility of the mutilation. Such at any rate is the
case for a mind that can properly brood. There is
a presence in what is missing—there is history in
there being so little. It is so little, to-day, that every
item of the handful counts.
</p>

<p>
The biggest items are of course the two ruins, the
great church and its tall tower, now quite on the
verge of the cliff, and the crumbled, ivied wall of the
immense cincture of the Priory. These things have
parted with almost every grace, but they still keep
up the work that they have been engaged in for centuries
and that cannot better be described than as
the adding of mystery to mystery. This accumulation,
at present prodigious, is, to the brooding mind,
unconscious as the shrunken little Dunwich of to-day
may be of it, the beginning and the end of the matter.
I hasten to add that it is to the brooding mind only,
and from it, that I speak. The mystery sounds for
ever in the hard, straight tide, and hangs, through
the long, still summer days and over the low, diked
fields, in the soft, thick light. We play with it as with
the answerless question, the question of the spirit
and attitude, never again to be recovered, of the
little city submerged. For it <i>was</i> a city, the main
port of Suffolk, as even its poor relics show; with a
fleet of its own on the North Sea, and a big religious
house on the hill. We wonder what were then the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323" name="Page_323" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_323">323</a></span>
apparent conditions of security, and on what rough
calculation a community could so build itself out to
meet its fate. It keeps one easy company here to-day
to think of the whole business as a magnificent mistake.
But Mr. Swinburne, in verses of an extraordinary
poetic eloquence, quite brave enough for
whatever there may have been, glances in the right
direction much further than I can do. Read moreover,
for other glances, the “Letters of Edward
FitzGerald,” Suffolk worthy and whimsical subject,
who, living hard by at Woodbridge, haunted these
regions during most of his life, and has left, in delightful
pages, at the service of the emulous visitor,
the echo of every odd, quaint air they could draw
from his cracked, sweet instrument. He has paid his
tribute, I seem to remember, to the particular delicate
flower—the pale Dunwich rose—that blooms
on the walls of the Priory. The emulous visitor, only
yesterday, on the most vulgar of vehicles—which,
however, he is quite aware he must choose between
using and abusing—followed, in the mellow afternoon,
one of these faint hints across the land and as
far as the old, old town of Aldeburgh, the birthplace
and the commemorated “Borough” of the poet
Crabbe.
</p>

<p>
FitzGerald, devoted to Crabbe, was apparently not
less so to this small break in the wide, low, heathery
bareness that brings the sweet Suffolk commons—rare
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324" name="Page_324" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_324">324</a></span>
purple and gold when I arrived—nearly to the
edge of the sea. We don’t, none the less, always
gather the particular impression we bravely go forth
to seek. We doubtless gather another indeed that
will serve as well any such turn as here may wait for
it; so that if it was somehow not easy to work FitzGerald
into the small gentility of the sea-front, the
little “marina,” as of a fourth-rate watering-place,
that has elbowed away, evidently in recent years, the
old handful of character, one could at least, to make
up for that, fall back either on the general sense of
the happy trickery of genius or on the special beauty
of the mixture, in the singer of Omar Khayyam,
that, giving him such a place for a setting, could yet
feed his fancy so full. Crabbe, at Aldeburgh, for that
matter, is perhaps even more wonderful—in the
light, I mean, of what is left of the place by one’s
conjuring away the little modern vulgar accumulation.
What is left is just the stony beach and the big
gales and the cluster of fishermen’s huts and the
small, wide, short street of decent, homely, shoppy
houses. These are the private emotions of the historic
sense—glimpses in which we recover for an
hour, or rather perhaps, with an intensity, but for
the glimmer of a minute, the conditions that, grimly
enough, could engender masterpieces, or at all
events classics. What a mere pinch of manners and
customs in the midst of winds and waves! Yet if it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325" name="Page_325" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_325">325</a></span>
was a feature of these to return a member to Parliament,
what wonder that, up to the Reform Bill, dead
Dunwich should have returned two?
</p>

<p>
The glimpses I speak of are, in all directions, the
constant company of the afternoon “spin.” Beginning,
modestly enough, at Dunwich itself, they end,
for intensity, as far inland as you have time to go;
far enough—this is the great point—to have
shown you, in their quiet vividness of type, a placid
series of the things into which you may most read
the old story of what is softest in the English complexity.
I scarce know what murmur has been for
weeks in my ears if it be not that of the constant
word that, as a recall of the story, may serve to be
put under the vignette. And yet this word is in its
last form nothing more eloquent than the mere
admonition to be pleased. Well, so you are, even as
I was yesterday at Wesselton with the characteristic
“value” that expressed itself, however shyly, in the
dear old red inn at which I halted for the queer
restorative—I thus discharge my debt to it—of a
bottle of lemonade with a “dash.” The dash was only
of beer, but the refreshment was immense. So even
was that of the sight of a dim, draped, sphinx-like
figure that loomed, at the end of a polished passage,
out of a little dusky back parlour which had a windowful
of the choked light of a small green garden—a
figure proving to be an old woman desirous to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326" name="Page_326" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_326">326</a></span>
dilate on all the years she had sat there with rheumatism
“most cruel.” So, inveterately—and in
these cases without the after-taste—is that of the
pretty little park gates you pass to skirt the walls and
hedges beyond which the great affair, the greatest
of all, the deep, still home, sits in the midst of its
acres and strikes you all the more for being, precisely,
so unrenowned. It is the charming repeated
lesson that the amenity of the famous seats in this
country is nothing to that of the lost and buried ones.
This impression in particular may bring you round
again harmoniously to Dunwich and above all perhaps
to where the Priory, laid, as I may say, flat on
its back, rests its large outline on what was once the
high ground, with the inevitable “big” house, beyond
and a little above, folded, for privacy, in a neat,
impenetrable wood. Here as elsewhere the cluster
offers without complication just the signs of the type.
At the base of the hill are the dozen cottages to
which the village has been reduced, and one of which
contains, to my hearing, though by no means, alas,
to his own, a very ancient man who will count for you
on his fingers, till they fail, the grand acres that, in
his day, he has seen go the way of the rest. He likes
to figure that he ploughed of old where only the sea
ploughs now. Dunwich, however, will still last his
time; and that of as many others as—to repeat my
hint—may yet be drawn here (though not, I hope,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327" name="Page_327" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_327">327</a></span>
on the instance of these prudent lines) to judge for
themselves into how many meanings a few elements
can compose. One never need be bored, after all,
when “composition” really rules. It rules in the way
the brown hamlet really disposes itself, and the grey
square tower of the church, in just the right relation,
peeps out of trees that remind me exactly of those
which, in the frontispieces of Birket Foster, offered
to my childish credulity the very essence of England.
Let me put it directly for old Suffolk that this credulity
finds itself here, at the end of time, more than
ever justified. Let me put it perhaps also that the
very essence of England has a way of presenting
itself with completeness in almost any fortuitous
combination of rural objects at all, so that, wherever
you may be, you get, reduced and simplified, the
whole of the scale. The big house and its woods are
always at hand; with a “party” always, in the intervals
of shooting, to bring down to the rustic sports
that keep up the tradition of the village green. The
russet, low-browed inn, the “ale-house” of Shakespeare,
the immemorial fountain of beer, looking
over that expanse, swings, with an old-time story-telling
creak, the sign of the Marquis of Carabas.
The pretty girls, within sight of it, alight from the
Marquis’s wagonette; the young men with the one
eye-glass and the new hat sit beside them on the
benches supplied for their sole accommodation, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328" name="Page_328" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_328">328</a></span>
thanks to which the meditator on manners has, a
little, the image, gathered from faded fictions by
female hands, of the company brought over, for the
triumph of the heroine, to the hunt or the county
ball. And it is always Hodge and Gaffer that, at
bottom, <i>font les frais</i>—always the mild children of
the glebe on whom, in the last resort, the complex
superstructure rests.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">IN OLD SUFFOLK</p>
</div>

<p>
The discovery, in the twilight of time, of the
merits, as a building-site, of Hodge’s broad bent
back remains surely one of the most sagacious
strokes of the race from which the squire and the
parson were to be evolved. He is there in force—at
the rustic sports—in force or in feebleness, with
Mrs. Hodge and the Miss Hodges, who participate
with a silent glee in the chase, over fields where
their shadows are long, of a pig with a greased tail.
He pulls his forelock in the tent in which, after the
pig is caught, the rewards of valour are dispensed by
the squire’s lady, and if he be in favour for respectability
and not behind with rent, he penetrates later
to the lawn within the wood, where he is awaited by
a band of music and a collation of beer, buns, and
tobacco.
</p>

<p>
I mention these things as some of the light notes,
but the picture is never too empty for a stronger one
not to sound. The strongest, at Dunwich, is indeed
one that, without in the least falsifying the scale,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329" name="Page_329" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_329">329</a></span>
counts immensely for filling in. The palm in the
rustic sports is for the bluejackets; as, in England, of
course, nothing is easier than for the village green to
alternate with the element that Britannia still more
admirably rules. I had often dreamed that the ideal
refuge for a man of letters was a cottage so placed on
the coast as to be circled, as it were, by the protecting
arm of the Admiralty. I remember to have heard it
said in the old country—in New York and Boston—that
the best place to live in is next to an engine-house,
and it is on this analogy that, at Dunwich, I
have looked for ministering peace in near neighbourhood
to one of those stations of the coast-guard that,
round all the edge of England, at short intervals, on
rock and sand and heath, make, with shining whitewash
and tar, clean as a great state is at least theoretically
clean, each its own little image of the reach
of the empire. It is in each case an image that, for
one reason and another, you respond to with a sort
of thrill; and the thing becomes as concrete as you
can wish on your discovering in the three or four
individual members of the simple staff of the establishment
all sorts of educated decency and many
sorts of beguilement to intercourse. Prime among
the latter, in truth, is the great yarn-spinning gift.
It differs from man to man, but here and there it
glows like a cut ruby. May the last darkness close
before I cease to care for sea-folk!—though this, I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330" name="Page_330" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58938/58938-h/58938-h.htm#Page_330">330</a></span>
hasten to add, is not the private predilection at
which, in these incoherent notes, I proposed most to
glance. Let me have mentioned it merely as a sign
that the fault is all my own if, this summer, the arm
of the Admiralty has not, in the full measure of my
theory, represented the protection under which the
long literary morning may know—abyss of delusion!—nothing
but itself.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
